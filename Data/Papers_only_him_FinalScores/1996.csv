A New Statistical Parser Based on Bigram Lexical Dependencies  This paper describes a new statistical parser which is based on probabilities of dependencies between head-words in the parse tree.,2,0.9833333333333333,2,30,1996
Standard bigram probability estimation techniques are extended to calculate probabilities of dependencies between pairs of words.,2,1.0588235294117647,1,17,1996
Tests using Wall Street Journal data show that the method performs at least as well as SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al.,4,1.0,3,25,1996
"94), which has the best published results for a statistical parser on this task.",2,0.6764705882352942,2,17,1996
"The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes.",2,0.7941176470588235,2,17,1996
With a beam search strategy parsing speed can be improved to over 200 sentences a minute with negligible loss in accuracy.,2,0.7954545454545454,2,22,1996
"Lexical information has been shown to be crucial for many parsing decisions, such as prepositional-phrase attachment (for example (Hindle and Rooth 93)).",3,0.8214285714285714,2,28,1996
"However, early approaches to probabilistic parsing (Pereira and Schabes 92; Magerman and Marcus 91; Briscoe and Carroll 93) conditioned probabilities on non-terminal labels and part of speech tags alone.",4,0.7857142857142857,4,35,1996
The SPATTER parser (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al.,3,0,2,11,1996
"94) does use lexical information, and recovers labeled constituents in Wall Street Journal text with above 84% accuracy  as far as we know the best published results on this task.",3,0.8529411764705882,3,34,1996
"This paper describes a new parser which is much simpler than SPATTER, yet performs at least as well when trained and tested on the same Wall Street Journal data.",3,0.8709677419354839,3,31,1996
The method uses lexical information directly by modeling head-modier1 relations between pairs of words.,2,0.9,2,15,1996
In this way it is similar to  The aim of a parser is to take a tagged sentence as input (for example Figure 1(a)) and produce a phrase-structure tree as output (Figure 1(b)).,3,0.9886363636363636,4,44,1996
A statistical approach to this problem consists of two components.,2,0.7727272727272727,1,11,1996
"First, the statistical model assigns a probability to every candidate parse tree for a sentence.",2,0.8235294117647058,2,17,1996
"Formally, given a sentence S and a tree T , the model estimates the conditional probability P (T |S).",3,0.6041666666666666,4,24,1996
The most likely parse under the model is then.,2,0.85,1,10,1996
"Second, the parser is a method for nding Tbest.",2,0.7727272727272727,1,11,1996
"This section describes the statistical model, while section 3 describes the parser.",2,0.7142857142857143,2,14,1996
The key to the statistical model is that any tree such as Figure 1(b) can be represented as a set of baseNPs2 and a set of dependencies as in Figure 1(c).,3,0.9210526315789473,3,38,1996
"We call the set of baseNPs B, and the set of dependencies D; Figure 1(d) shows B and D for this example.",3,0,3,28,1996
"For the purposes of our model, T = (B, D), and.",3,0,4,17,1996
S is the sentence with words tagged for part of speech.,1,1.2083333333333333,1,12,1996
"That is, S =< (w1, t1), (w2, t2)...(wn, tn) >.",5,1.06,2,25,1996
For POS tagging we use a maximum-entropy tagger described in (Ratnaparkhi 96).,2,0.7666666666666667,2,15,1996
"The tagger performs at around 97% accuracy on Wall Street Journal Text, and is trained on the rst 40,000 sentences of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.",4,0.7096774193548387,3,31,1996
93).,1,0,1,3,1996
"Given S and B, the reduced sentence S is dened as the subsequence of S which is formed by removing punctuation and reducing all baseNPs to their head-word alone.",2,0.8870967741935484,2,31,1996
"2A baseNP or minimal NP is a non-recursive NP, i.e.",2,0.7727272727272727,2,11,1996
none of its child constituents are NPs.,2,0.9375,1,8,1996
The term was rst used in (Ramshaw and Marcus 95).,2,1.0,2,13,1996

Square brackets enclose baseNPs (heads of baseNPs are marked in bold).,2,1.1428571428571428,2,14,1996
Arrows show modier  head dependencies.,1,0.75,2,6,1996
Section 2.1 describes how arrows are labeled with non-terminal triples from the parse-tree.,2,1.0,2,14,1996
"Non-head words within baseNPs are excluded from the dependency structure; (d) B, the set of baseNPs, and D, the set of dependencies, are extracted from (c).",3,0.8472222222222222,3,36,1996
Sections 2.1 to 2.4 describe the dependency model.,2,0.8333333333333334,1,9,1996
"Section 2.5 then describes the baseNP model, which uses bigram tagging techniques similar to (Ramshaw and Marcus 95; Church 88).",3,0.8,2,25,1996
The Mapping from Trees to Sets of Dependencies  The dependency model is limited to relationships between words in reduced sentences such as Example 1.,2,1.06,1,25,1996
The mapping from trees to dependency structures is central to the dependency model.,2,0.8928571428571429,2,14,1996
It is dened in two steps.,1,0.9285714285714286,1,7,1996

For each constituent P < C1...Cn > in the parse tree a simple set of rules3 identies which of the children Ci is the head-child of P .,3,0.7666666666666667,2,30,1996
"For example, NN would be identied as the head-child of NP <DET JJ JJ NN>, VP would be identied as the head-child of S <NP VP>.",3,0.96,2,25,1996
"Head-words propagate up through the tree, each parent receiving its head-word from its head-child.",2,0.78125,2,16,1996
"For example, in S <NP VP>, S gets its head-word, announced,  3The rules are essentially the same as in (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al.",4,0.8,3,30,1996
94).,1,0,1,3,1996
"These rules are also used to nd the head-word of baseNPs, enabling the mapping from S and B to S.  Figure 2.",2,0.8541666666666666,3,24,1996

The head-word for each constituent is shown in parentheses.,2,0.95,1,10,1996

Head-modier relationships are now extracted from the tree in Figure 2.,2,0.875,1,12,1996
Figure 3 illustrates how each constituent contributes a set of dependency relationships.,2,1.0,2,13,1996
VBD is identied as the head-child of VP  <VBD NP NP>.,1,0.95,3,10,1996
"The head-words of the two NPs, resignation and yesterday, both modify the head-word of the VBD, announced.",5,0.6904761904761905,3,21,1996
"Dependencies are labeled by the modier non-terminal, NP in both of these cases, the parent non-terminal, VP, and nally the head-child non-terminal, VBD.",4,0.7413793103448276,4,29,1996
"The triple of nonterminals at the start, middle and end of the arrow specify the nature of the dependency relationship  <NP,S,VP> represents a subject-verb dependency, <PP,NP,NP> denotes prepositional phrase modication of an NP, and so on4.",4,0.9326923076923077,3,52,1996
Figure 3.,1,1,1,3,1996
Each constituent with n children (in this case n = 3) contributes n  1 dependencies.,3,0.9166666666666666,3,18,1996
"Each word in the reduced sentence, with the exception of the sentential head announced, modies exactly one other word.",3,0.7045454545454546,3,22,1996
"We use the notation  to state that the jth word in the reduced sentence is a modier to the hjth word, with relationship 5.",3,0.7692307692307693,3,26,1996
AF stands for arrow from.,1,1.0833333333333333,1,6,1996
"Rj is the triple Rj of labels at the start, middle and end of the arrow.",3,0.8611111111111112,2,18,1996
"For example, w1 = Smith in this sentence,  The triple can also be viewed as representing a semantic predicate-argument relationship, with the three elements being the type of the argument, result and functor respectively.",3,0.7948717948717948,4,39,1996
"This is particularly apparent in Categorial Grammar formalisms (Wood 93), which make an explicit link between dependencies and functional application.",2,0.875,2,24,1996
"2.2 Calculating Dependency Probabilities This section describes the way P (AF (j)|S, B) is estimated.",4,0.9130434782608695,2,23,1996
"The same sentence is very unlikely to appear both in training and test data, so we need to back-o from the entire sentence context.",3,0.6923076923076923,2,26,1996
"We believe that lexical information is crucial to attachment decisions, so it is natural to condition on the words and tags.",3,0.7608695652173914,2,23,1996
"Let V be the vocabulary of all words seen in training data, T be the set of all part-of-speech tags, and T RAIN be the training set, a set of reduced sentences.",3,0.8055555555555556,3,36,1996
We dene the following functions.,1,0.75,1,6,1996
An estimate based on the identities of the two tokens alone is problematic.,3,0.8928571428571429,1,14,1996
"Additional context, in particular the relative order of the two words and the distance between them, will also strongly inuence the likelihood of one word modifying the other.",3,0.7903225806451613,3,31,1996
For example consider the relationship between sales and the three tokens of of.,2,0.8928571428571429,2,14,1996
"Example 2 Shaw, based in Dalton, Ga., has annual sales of about $ 1.18 billion, and has economies of scale and lower raw-material costs that are expected to boost the protability of Armstrong s brands, sold under the Armstrong and Evans-Black names .",4,0.7916666666666666,4,48,1996
In this sentence sales and of co-occur three times.,2,0,2,10,1996
"The parse tree in training data indicates a relationship in only one of these cases, so this sentence would contribute an estimate of 1 3 that the two words are related.",3,0.7727272727272727,3,33,1996
This seems unreasonably low given that sales of is a strong collocation.,2,1.0,2,13,1996
The latter two instances of of are so distant from sales that it is unlikely that there will be a dependency.,2,0.9772727272727273,2,22,1996
This suggests that distance is a crucial variable when deciding whether two words are related.,2,1.1875,2,16,1996
"It is included in the model by dening an extra distance variable, , and extending C, F and F to include this variable.",4,0.6153846153846154,4,26,1996
"For example, C( ha, bi , hc, di , ) is the number of times ha, bi and hc, di appear in the same sentence at a distance  apart.",4,0.75,4,36,1996
(11) is then maximised instead of (10).,2,0.9583333333333334,2,12,1996
"A simple example of j,hj would be j,hj = hj  j.",1,0.9666666666666667,2,15,1996
"However, other features of a sentence, such as punctuation, are also useful when deciding if two words  are related.",3,0.9347826086956522,3,23,1996
"We have developed a heuristic distance measure which takes several such features into account The current distance measure j,hj is the combination of 6 features, or questions (we motivate the choice of these questions qualitatively  section 4 gives quantitative results showing their merit).",3,0.9693877551020408,3,49,1996
Question 1 Does the hjth word precede or follow the jth word?,2,0.6153846153846154,2,13,1996
"English is a language with strong word order, so the order of the two words in surface text will clearly aect their dependency statistics.",3,0,3,26,1996
Question 2 Are the hjth word and the jth word adjacent?,3,0.625,2,12,1996
"English is largely right-branching and head-initial, which leads to a large proportion of dependencies being between adjacent words 7.",2,0.9761904761904762,3,21,1996

Percentage of dependencies vs. number of verbs between the head words involved.,2,1.1923076923076923,2,13,1996
Question 3 Is there a verb between the hjth word and the jth word?,2,0.7333333333333333,2,15,1996
"Conditioning on the exact distance between two words by making j,hj = hj  j leads to severe sparse data problems.",4,0.717391304347826,3,23,1996
But Table 1 shows the need to make ner distance distinctions than just whether two words are adjacent.,2,0.8157894736842105,2,19,1996
"Consider the prepositions to, in and of in the following sentence.",2,0.7692307692307693,2,13,1996
"Example 3 Oil stocks escaped the brunt of Friday s selling and several were able to post gains , including Chevron , which rose 5/8 to 66 3/8 in Big Board composite trading of 2.4 million shares .",3,0.8918918918918919,2,37,1996
"The prepositions main candidates for attachment would appear to be the previous verb, rose, and the baseNP heads between each preposition and this verb.",5,0.9074074074074074,3,27,1996
They are less likely to modify a more distant verb such as escaped.,2,1.0714285714285714,2,14,1996
"Question 3 allows the parser to prefer modication of the most recent verb  eectively another, weaker preference for right-branching structures.",3,1.0,2,22,1996
"Table 2 shows that 94% of dependencies do not cross a verb, giving empirical evidence that question 3 is useful.",3,1.0434782608695652,3,23,1996
7For example in (John (likes (to (go (to (University (of Pennsylvania))))))) all dependencies are between adjacent words.,6,0.8125,2,32,1996
" Are there 0, 1, 2, or more than 2 commas between the hjth word and the jth word?",3,0.6590909090909091,3,22,1996
"(All symbols tagged as a , or . are considered to be commas).",2,0.7222222222222222,3,9,1996
 Is there a comma immediately following the  rst of the hjth word and the jth word?,2,0,2,17,1996
 Is there a comma immediately preceding the  second of the hjth word and the jth word?,2,0,2,17,1996
"People nd that punctuation is extremely useful for identifying phrase structure, and the parser described here also relies on it heavily.",3,0.9130434782608695,3,23,1996
Commas are not considered to be words or modiers in the dependency model  but they do give strong indications about the parse structure.,3,0.6875,3,24,1996
"Questions 4, 5 and 6 allow the parser to use this information.",2,0.8571428571428571,2,14,1996
"The maximum likelihood estimator is likely to be plagued by sparse data problems  C( h wj , tji , h whj , thj i , j,hj ) may be too low to give a reliable estimate, or worse still it may be zero leaving the estimate undened.",4,0.9615384615384616,2,52,1996
(Collins 95) describes how a backed-o estimation strategy is used for making prepositional phrase attachment decisions.,2,0.868421052631579,3,19,1996
The idea is to back-o to estimates based on less context.,1,1.0833333333333333,2,12,1996
"In this case, less context means looking at the POS tags rather than the specic words.",2,0.7222222222222222,2,18,1996
"There are four estimates, E1, E2, E3 and E4, based respectively on.",4,0.6176470588235294,3,17,1996
1) both words and both tags; 2) wj and the two POS tags; 3) whj and the two POS tags; 4) the two POS tags alone.,5,0.7205882352941176,5,34,1996
where V is the set of all words seen in training data.,1,1.1153846153846154,1,13,1996
the other denitions of C follow similarly.,2,0.9375,1,8,1996
Estimates 2 and 3 compete  for a given pair of words in test data both estimates may exist and they are equally specic to the test case example.,4,0.7068965517241379,2,29,1996
"(Collins 95) suggests the following way of combining them, which favours the estimate appearing more often in training data.",2,0.9782608695652174,2,23,1996
This gives three estimates.,1,0.9,1,5,1996
"E1, E23 and E4, a similar situation to trigram language modeling for speech recognition (Jelinek 90), where there are trigram, bigram and unigram estimates.",3,0.6290322580645161,3,31,1996
"(Jelinek 90) describes a deleted interpolation method which combines these estimates to give a smooth estimate, and the model uses a variation of this idea.",4,0.7586206896551724,3,29,1996
These  values have the desired property of increasing as the denominator of the more specic estimator increases.,2,0.8333333333333334,2,18,1996
"We think that a proper implementation of deleted interpolation is likely to improve results, although basing estimates on co-occurrence counts alone has the advantage of reduced training times.",2,0.9666666666666667,3,30,1996
The overall model would be simpler if we could do without the baseNP model and frame everything in terms of dependencies.,2,0.9090909090909091,2,22,1996
However the baseNP model is needed for two reasons.,2,0.75,1,10,1996
"First, while adjacency between words is a good indicator of whether there is some relationship between them, this indicator is made substantially stronger if baseNPs are reduced to a single word.",3,0.9705882352941176,3,34,1996
it means that words internal to baseNPs are not included in the co-occurrence counts in training data.,2,1.0555555555555556,3,18,1996
"Otherwise,  Second, in a phrase like The Securities and Exchange Commission closed yesterday, pre-modifying nouns like Securities and Exchange would be included in cooccurrence counts, when in practice there is no way that they can modify words outside their baseNP.",2,0.9111111111111111,4,45,1996
"The baseNP model can be viewed as tagging the gaps between words with S(tart), C(ontinue), E(nd), B(etween) or N (ull) symbols, respectively meaning that the gap is at the start of a BaseN P , continues a BaseN P , is at the end of a BaseN P , is between two adjacent baseN P s, or is between two words which are both not in BaseN.",6,0.8275862068965517,4,87,1996
We call the gap before the ith word Gi.,2,0.65,2,10,1996
"Probability estimates are based on counts of consecutive pairs of words in unreduced training data sentences, where baseNP boundaries dene whether gaps fall into the S, C, E, B or N categories.",3,0.7432432432432432,2,37,1996
The probability of a baseNP sequence in an unreduced sentence S is then.,3,0.75,2,14,1996
The estimation method is analogous to that described in the sparse data section of this paper.,2,0.7941176470588235,2,17,1996
"The method is similar to that described in (Ramshaw and Marcus 95; Church 88), where baseNP detection is also framed as a tagging problem.",3,0.896551724137931,3,29,1996
"The denominator in Equation (9) is not actually constant for dierent baseNP sequences, but we make this approximation for the sake of eciency and simplicity.",4,0,2,29,1996
"In practice this is a good approximation because most baseNP boundaries are very well dened, so parses which have high enough P (B|S) to be among the highest scoring parses for a sentence tend to have identical or very similar baseNPs.",3,0.9893617021276596,3,47,1996
Parses are ranked by the following quantity9.,1,0.8125,1,8,1996
The parser nds the tree which maximises (20) subject to the hard constraint that dependencies cannot cross.,2,1.2619047619047619,2,21,1996
"In fact we also model the set of unary productions, U , in the tree, which are of the form P < C1 >.",2,0.9259259259259259,3,27,1996
"This introduces an additional term, P (U |B, S), into (20).",3,0.725,3,20,1996
This section describes two modications which improve the models performance.,2,1.0,2,11,1996
" In addition to conditioning on whether dependencies cross commas, a single constraint concerning punctuation is introduced.",3,1.1111111111111112,2,18,1996
"If for any constituent Z in the chart Z  <.. X Y ..> two of its children X and Y are separated by a comma, then the last word in Y must be directly followed by a comma, or must be the last word in the sentence.",2,0,2,11,1996
In training data 96% of commas follow this rule.,2,0.8636363636363636,1,11,1996
The rule also has the benet of improving eciency by reducing the number of constituents in the chart.,2,1.131578947368421,2,19,1996
" The model we have described thus far takes the single best sequence of tags from the tagger, and it is clear that there is potential for better integration of the tagger and parser.",3,0.9142857142857143,2,35,1996
We have tried two modications.,1,0.9166666666666666,1,6,1996
"First, the current estimation methods treat occurrences of the same word with dierent POS tags as eectively distinct types.",2,0.6904761904761905,2,21,1996
Tags can be ignored when lexical information is available by dening  where T is the set of all tags.,1,1.25,2,20,1996
"Hence C (a, c) is the number of times that the words a and c occur in the same sentence, ignoring their tags.",3,0.875,4,28,1996
"The other denitions in (13) are similarly redened, with POS tags only being used when backing o from lexical information.",2,1.0,2,24,1996
This makes the parser less sensitive to tagging errors.,1,0.95,2,10,1996
"Second, for each word wi the tagger can provide the distribution of tag probabilities P (ti|S) (given the previous two words are tagged as in the best overall sequence of tags) rather than just the rst best tag.",4,0.717391304347826,3,46,1996
"The score for a parse in equation (20) then has an additional term, Qn i=1 P (ti|S), the product of probabilities of the tags which it contains.",3,1.0789473684210527,3,38,1996
Ideally we would like to integrate POS tagging into the parsing model rather than treating it as a separate stage.,2,0.9761904761904762,2,21,1996
This is an area for future research.,1,0.9375,1,8,1996
The parsing algorithm is a simple bottom-up chart parser.,2,0.45,3,10,1996
"There is no grammar as such, although in practice any dependency with a triple of nonterminals which has not been seen in training data will get zero probability.",2,1.05,4,30,1996
Thus the parser searches through the space of all trees with nonterminal triples seen in training data.,2,0.8611111111111112,2,18,1996
"Probabilities of baseNPs in the chart are calculated using (19), while probabilities for other constituents are derived from the dependencies and baseNPs that they contain.",2,1.0344827586206897,3,29,1996
A dynamic programming algorithm is used.,2,0.6428571428571429,1,7,1996

4 Results  The parser was trained on sections 02 - 21 of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.,3,0.9038461538461539,2,26,1996
"93) (approximately 40,000 sentences), and tested on section 23 (2,416 sentences).",3,0,3,18,1996
For comparison SPATTER (Magerman 95; Jelinek et al.,2,1,2,11,1996
94) was also tested on section 23.,1,0.8333333333333334,1,9,1996
We use the PARSEVAL measures (Black et al.,1,1.05,2,10,1996
91) to compare performance.,1,1.3333333333333333,1,6,1996
"For a constituent to be correct it must span the same set of words (ignoring punctuation, i.e.",1,1.0526315789473684,2,19,1996
"all tokens tagged as commas, colons or quotes) and have the same label10 as a constituent in the treebank 10SPATTER collapses ADVP and PRT to the same label, for comparison we also removed this distinction when  Table 4.",4,0.9047619047619048,3,42,1996
The contribution of various components of the model.,2,0,1,9,1996
The results are for all sentences of  100 words in section 23 using model (3).,2,1.0,2,18,1996
For no lexical information all estimates are based on POS tags alone.,2,0.7307692307692307,2,13,1996
For no distance measure the distance measure is Question 1 alone (i.e.,1,1.0769230769230769,2,13,1996

Four congurations of the parser were tested.,2,0.9375,1,8,1996
"(1) The basic model; (2) The basic model with the punctuation rule described in section 2.7; (3) Model (2) with tags ignored when lexical information is present, as described in 2.7; and (4) Model (3) also using the full probability distributions for POS tags.",3,0.7377049180327869,4,61,1996
"We should emphasise that test data outside of section 23 was used for all development of the model, avoiding the danger of implicit training on section 23.",2,0.9482758620689655,2,29,1996
Table 3 shows the results of the tests.,1,0.8333333333333334,1,9,1996
Table 4 shows results which indicate how dierent parts of the system contribute to performance.,2,1.15625,2,16,1996
"All tests were made on a Sun SPARCServer 1000E, using 100% of a 60Mhz SuperSPARC processor.",2,0.6842105263157895,2,19,1996
"The parser uses around 180 megabytes of memory, and training on 40,000 sentences (essentially extracting the co-occurrence counts from the corpus) takes under 15 minutes.",3,0.8793103448275862,4,29,1996
Loading the hash table of bigram counts into memory takes approximately 8 minutes.,2,0.9642857142857143,2,14,1996
Two strategies are employed to improve parsing eciency.,1,1.0,1,9,1996
"First, a constant probability threshold is used while building the chart  any constituents with lower probability than this threshold are discarded.",2,0.7608695652173914,3,23,1996
"If a parse is found, it must be the highest ranked parse by the model.",2,1.088235294117647,2,17,1996
"If no parse is found, the threshold is lowered and parsing is attempted again.",4,0.78125,2,16,1996
The process continues until a parse is found.,1,1.0,2,9,1996
"Second, a beam search strategy is used.",2,0.6111111111111112,2,9,1996
"For each span of words in the sentence the probability, Ph, of the highest probability constituent is recorded.",3,0.8333333333333334,3,21,1996
All other constituents spanning the same words must have probability greater than Ph  for some constant beam size   constituents which fall out of this beam are discarded.,3,1.0,3,28,1996
"The method risks introducing search-errors, but in practice eciency can be greatly improved with virtually no loss of accuracy.",3,0,2,21,1996
Table 5 shows the trade-o between speed and accuracy as the beam is narrowed.,2,0.8666666666666667,3,15,1996
Table 5.,1,1,1,3,1996
The trade-o between speed and accuracy as the beam-size is varied.,2,0.875,2,12,1996
Model (3) was used for this test on all sentences  100 words in section 23.,2,0.9166666666666666,2,18,1996
We have shown that a simple statistical model based on dependencies between words can parse Wall Street Journal news text with high accuracy.,2,0.875,3,24,1996
The method is equally applicable to tree or dependency representations of syntactic structures.,2,0.6785714285714286,1,14,1996
"There are many possibilities for improvement, which is encouraging.",1,1.2727272727272727,1,11,1996
More sophisticated estimation techniques such as deleted interpolation should be tried.,2,1.0,1,12,1996
Estimates based on relaxing the distance measure could also be used for smoothing  at present we only back-o on words.,2,1.2857142857142858,2,21,1996
"The distance measure could be extended to capture more context, such as other words or tags in the sentence.",2,0.7619047619047619,2,21,1996
"Finally, the model makes no account of valency.",2,0.85,1,10,1996
"I would like to thank Mitch Marcus, Jason Eisner, Dan Melamed and Adwait Ratnaparkhi for many useful discussions, and for comments on earlier versions of this paper.",3,0.7741935483870968,4,31,1996
I would also like to thank David Magerman for his help with testing SPATTER.,2,1.0,2,15,1996
