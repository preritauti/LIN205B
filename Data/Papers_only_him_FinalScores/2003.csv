Head-Driven Statistical Models for Natural Language Parsing  Michael Collins MIT Computer Science and Articial Intelligence Laboratory  This article describes three statistical models for natural language parsing.,3,0.6481481481481481,1,27,2003
"The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.",2,0.9078947368421053,3,38,2003
"Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment.",7,1.0147058823529411,2,34,2003
All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.,2,1.0384615384615385,1,13,2003
"The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature.",3,0.78,3,25,2003
"To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.",4,0.803030303030303,2,33,2003
"We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.",4,0.896551724137931,3,29,2003
"Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models.",2,1.09375,2,32,2003
Ambiguity is a central problem in natural language parsing.,2,0.75,2,10,2003
Combinatorial effects mean that even relatively short sentences can receive a considerable number of parses under a wide-coverage grammar.,2,0.75,3,20,2003
"Statistical parsing approaches tackle the ambiguity problem by assigning a probability to each parse tree, thereby ranking competing trees in order of plausibility.",2,0.9,2,25,2003
"In many statistical models the probability for each candidate tree is calculated as a product of terms, each term corresponding to some substructure within the tree.",2,0.8392857142857143,2,28,2003
The choice of parameterization is essentially the choice of how to represent parse trees.,2,1.1333333333333333,2,15,2003
There are two critical questions regarding the parameterization of a parsing approach.,2,0.8076923076923077,2,13,2003
1.,0,1.25,0,2,2003
"Which linguistic objects (e.g., context-free rules, parse moves) should the  models parameters be associated with?",3,1.125,2,20,2003
"In other words, which features should be used to discriminate among alternative parse trees?",2,1.03125,2,16,2003
How can this choice be instantiated in a sound probabilistic model?,2,0,2,12,2003
"In this article we explore these issues within the framework of generative models, more precisely, the history-based models originally introduced to parsing by Black.",5,0,2,27,2003
"In a history-based model, a parse tree is represented as a sequence of decisions, the decisions being made in some derivation of the tree.",2,0.7962962962962963,2,27,2003
"Each decision has an associated probability, and the product of these probabilities denes a probability distribution over possible derivations.",3,0,2,21,2003
We rst describe three parsing models based on this approach.,2,1.0,2,11,2003
The models were originally introduced in Collins (1997); the current article1 gives considerably more detail about the models and discusses them in greater depth.,3,0,2,28,2003
In Model 1 we show one approach that extends methods from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) to lexicalized grammars.,2,1.0,2,21,2003
"Most importantly, the model has parameters corresponding to dependencies between pairs of headwords.",2,1.0333333333333334,1,15,2003
"We also show how to incorporate a distance measure into these models, by generalizing the model to a history-based approach.",2,0.8863636363636364,3,22,2003
"The distance measure allows the model to learn a preference for close attachment, or right-branching structures.",3,0.7777777777777778,2,18,2003
"In Model 2, we extend the parser to make the complement/adjunct distinction, which will be important for most applications using the output from the parser.",2,0.9285714285714286,2,28,2003
Model 2 is also extended to have parameters corresponding directly to probability distributions over subcategorization frames for headwords.,2,1.105263157894737,2,19,2003
The new parameters lead to an improvement in accuracy.,2,0.85,1,10,2003
In Model 3 we give a probabilistic treatment of wh-movement that is loosely based on the analysis of wh-movement in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al.,2,0.984375,3,32,2003
1985).,1,0,1,3,2003
The output of the parser is now enhanced to show trace coindexations in wh-movement cases.,2,0.9375,2,16,2003
"The parameters in this model are interesting in that they correspond directly to the probability of propagating GPSG-style slash features through parse trees, potentially allowing the model to learn island constraints.",2,1.121212121212121,3,33,2003
"In the three models a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.",2,0.74,3,25,2003
"Independence assumptions then follow naturally, leading to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment.",4,1.0,2,36,2003
All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.,2,1.0384615384615385,1,13,2003
For this reason we refer to the models as head-driven statistical models.,2,0.8076923076923077,2,13,2003
"We describe evaluation of the three models on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",3,0.6875,2,24,2003
"Model 1 achieves 87.7% constituent precision and 87.5% consituent recall on sentences of up to 100 words in length in section 23 of the treebank, and Models 2 and 3 give further improvements to 88.3% constituent precision and 88.0% constituent recall.",5,0.6808510638297872,3,47,2003
These results are competitive with those of other models that have been applied to parsing the Penn Treebank.,2,1.0789473684210527,2,19,2003
Models 2 and 3 produce trees with information about wh-movement or subcategorization.,2,0,2,13,2003
Many NLP applications will need this information to extract predicate-argument structure from parse trees.,2,0.7,2,15,2003
The rest of the article is structured as follows.,2,1.1,1,10,2003
Section 2 gives background material on probabilistic context-free grammars and describes how rules can be lexicalized through the addition of headwords to parse trees.,2,1.1,4,25,2003
Section 3 introduces the three probabilistic models.,2,0.5625,2,8,2003
Section 4 describes various renments to these models.,2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003
"Section 5 discusses issues of parameter estimation, the treatment of unknown words, and also the parsing algorithm.",3,0.725,3,20,2003
"Section 6 gives results evaluating the performance of the models on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",3,0.7222222222222222,2,27,2003
Section 7 investigates various aspects of the models in more detail.,2,0.875,1,12,2003
"We give a  Head-Driven Statistical Models for NL Parsing  detailed analysis of the parsers performance on treebank data, including results on different constituent types.",3,0.7115384615384616,3,26,2003
We also give a breakdown of precision and recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.,2,1.0,2,17,2003
The intention is to give a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the parsing models.,2,0.7777777777777778,2,18,2003
"Section 7 goes on to discuss the distance features in the models, the implicit assumptions that the models make about the treebank annotation style, and the way that context-free rules in the original treebank are broken down, allowing the models to generalize by producing new rules on test data examples.",3,0.8425925925925926,3,54,2003
"We analyze these phenomena through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.",4,0.8846153846153846,3,26,2003
"Finally, section 8 gives more discussion, by comparing the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank.",2,1.0434782608695652,2,23,2003
We aim to give some explanation of the differences in performance among the various models.,2,1.0,2,16,2003
Probabilistic context-free grammars are the starting point for the models in this article.,2,0.75,2,14,2003
"For this reason we briey recap the theory behind nonlexicalized PCFGs, before moving to the lexicalized case.",2,0.7894736842105263,2,19,2003
"Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979), we dene a context-free grammar G as a 4-tuple (N, , A, R), where N is a set of nonterminal symbols,  is an alphabet, A is a distinguished start symbol in N, and R is a nite set of rules, in which each rule is of the form X   for some X  N,   (N  ) .",6,0.86,3,75,2003
The grammar denes a set of possible strings in the language and also denes a set of possible leftmost derivations under the grammar.,3,0.8125,2,24,2003
Each derivation corresponds to a tree-sentence pair that is well formed under the grammar.,2,1.0,2,15,2003
A probabilistic context-free grammar is a simple modication of a context-free grammar in which each rule in the grammar has an associated probability P( | X).,2,0.7586206896551724,3,29,2003
"This can be interpreted as the conditional probability of Xs being expanded using the rule X  , as opposed to one of the other possibilities for expanding X listed in the grammar.",2,1.0303030303030303,3,33,2003
"The probability of a derivation is then a product of terms, each term corresponding to a rule application in the derivation.",2,0.8913043478260869,2,23,2003
"The probability of a given tree-sentence pair (T, S) derived by n applications of context-free rules LHSi  RHSi (where LHS stands for left-hand side, RHS for right-hand side), 1  i  n, under the PCFG is  Booth and Thompson (1973) specify the conditions under which the PCFG does in fact dene a distribution over the possible derivations (trees) generated by the underlying grammar.",3,1.0133333333333334,4,75,2003
The rst condition is that the rule probabilities dene conditional distributions over how each nonterminal in the grammar can expand.,2,0.9761904761904762,2,21,2003
The second is a technical condition that guarantees that the stochastic process generating trees terminates in a nite number of steps with probability one.,2,1.02,2,25,2003
A central problem in PCFGs is to dene the conditional probability P( | X) for each rule X   in the grammar.,3,0.7916666666666666,3,24,2003
A simple way to do this is to take counts from a treebank and then to use the maximum-likelihood estimates.,3,0.9285714285714286,2,21,2003
"If the treebank has actually been generated from a probabilistic context-free grammar with the same rules and nonterminals as the model, then in the limit, as the training sample size approaches innity, the probability distribution implied by these estimates will converge to the distribution of the underlying grammar.2  Once the model has been trained, we have a model that denes P(T, S) for any sentence-tree pair in the grammar.",5,0.8607594936708861,3,79,2003
"The output on a new test sentence S is the most likely tree under this model,  The parser itself is an algorithm that searches for the tree, Tbest, that maximizes P(T, S).",2,1.0,3,40,2003
"In the case of PCFGs, this can be accomplished using a variant of the CKY algorithm applied to weighted grammars (providing that the PCFG can be converted to an equivalent PCFG in Chomsky normal form); see, for example, Manning and Sch utze (1999).",4,0.9230769230769231,4,52,2003
"If the model probabilities P(T, S) are the same as the true distribution generating training and test examples, returning the most likely tree under P(T, S) will be optimal in terms of minimizing the expected error rate (number of incorrect trees) on newly drawn test examples.",4,0.8362068965517241,3,58,2003
"Hence if the data are generated by a PCFG, and there are enough training examples for the maximum-likelihood estimates to converge to the true values, then this parsing method will be optimal.",5,0.7285714285714285,4,35,2003
"In practice, these assumptions cannot be veried and are arguably quite strong, but these limitations have not prevented generative models from being successfully applied to many NLP and speech tasks.",3,0.6029411764705882,2,34,2003
(See Collins [2002] for a discussion of other ways of conceptualizing the parsing problem.),2,0.9473684210526315,3,19,2003
"In the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), which is the source of data for our experiments, the rules are either internal to the tree, where LHS is a nonterminal and RHS is a string of one or more nonterminals, or lexical, where LHS is a part-of-speech tag and RHS is a word.",5,0.859375,3,64,2003
(See Figure 1 for an example.),2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003
2.2 Lexicalized PCFGs A PCFG can be lexicalized3 by associating a word w and a part-of-speech (POS) tag t with each nonterminal X in the tree.,2,0.9137931034482759,3,29,2003
(See Figure 2 for an example tree.),2,0.65,2,10,2003
The PCFG model can be applied to these lexicalized rules and trees in exactly the same way as before.,2,0.675,2,20,2003
"Whereas before the nonterminals were simple (for example, S or NP), they are now extended to include a word and part-of-speech tag (for example, S(bought,VBD) or NP(IBM,NNP)).",4,0.7666666666666667,4,45,2003
"Thus we write a nonterminal as X(x), where x = (cid.6)w, t(cid.7) and X is a constituent label.",4,0.765625,4,32,2003
"Formally, nothing has changed, we have just vastly increased the number of nonterminals in the grammar (by up to a factor of |V|  |T |,  2 This point is actually more subtle than it rst appears (we thank one of the anonymous reviewers for pointing this out), and we were unable to nd proofs of this property in the literature for PCFGs.",5,1.047945205479452,4,73,2003
"The rule probabilities for any nonterminal that appears with probability greater than zero in parse derivations will converge to their underlying values, by the usual properties of maximum-likelihood estimation for multinomial distributions.",3,0.8823529411764706,2,34,2003
"Assuming that the underlying PCFG generating training examples meet both criteria in Booth and Thompson (1973), it can be shown that convergence of rule probabilities implies that the distribution over trees will converge to that of the underlying PCFG, at least when Kullback-Liebler divergence or the innity norm is taken to be the measure of distance between the two distributions.",3,0.9615384615384616,3,65,2003
Thanks to Tommi Jaakkola and Nathan Srebro for discussions on this topic.,2,0,2,13,2003
3 We nd lexical heads in Penn Treebank data using the rules described in Appendix A of Collins (1999).,3,1.0227272727272727,2,22,2003
The rules are a modied version of a head table provided by David Magerman and used in the parser described in Magerman (1995).,2,0.8653846153846154,3,26,2003
A lexicalized parse tree and a list of the rules it contains.,4,0.7307692307692307,2,13,2003
where |V| is the number of words in the vocabulary and |T | is the number of part-ofspeech tags).,3,0.875,2,24,2003
"Although nothing has changed from a formal point of view, the practical consequences of expanding the number of nonterminals quickly become apparent when one is attempting to dene a method for parameter estimation.",3,1.1,2,35,2003
"The simplest solution would be to use the maximum-likelihood estimate as in equation (1), for example,  But the addition of lexical items makes the statistics for this estimate very sparse.",4,0.7285714285714285,4,35,2003
"The count for the denominator is likely to be relatively low, and the number of outcomes (possible lexicalized RHSs) is huge, meaning that the numerator is very likely to be zero.",4,0.8472222222222222,3,36,2003
Predicting the whole lexicalized rule in one go is too big a step.,3,0,2,14,2003
"One way to overcome these sparse-data problems is to break down the generation of the RHS of each rule into a sequence of smaller steps, and then to make independence assumptions to reduce the number of parameters in the model.",4,1.0,3,42,2003
The decomposition of rules should aim to meet two criteria.,2,1.0909090909090908,1,11,2003
"First, the steps should be small enough for the parameter estimation problem to be feasible (i.e., in terms of having sufcient training data to train the model, providing that smoothing techniques are used to mitigate remaining sparse-data problems).",3,0.9545454545454546,4,44,2003
"Second, the independence assumptions made should be linguistically plausible.",2,0.9090909090909091,2,11,2003
In the next sections we describe three statistical parsing models that have an increasing degree of linguistic sophistication.,2,0.8421052631578947,2,19,2003
Model 1 uses a decomposition of which parameters corresponding to lexical dependencies are a natural result.,2,1.0,3,17,2003
The model also incorporates a preference for right-branching structures through conditioning on distance features.,2,0.9,2,15,2003
Model 2 extends the decomposition to include a step in which subcategorization frames are chosen probabilistically.,2,1.088235294117647,2,17,2003
Model 3 handles wh-movement by adding parameters corresponding to slash categories being passed from the parent of the rule to one of its children or being discharged as a trace.,3,1.096774193548387,3,31,2003
This section describes how the generation of the RHS of a rule is broken down into a sequence of smaller steps in model 1.,2,1.0,3,25,2003
The rst thing to note is that each internal rule in a lexicalized PCFG has the form.,2,0.8333333333333334,3,18,2003
"Note that lexical rules, in contrast to the internal rules, are completely deterministic.",3,0.875,3,16,2003
"They always take the form where P is a part-of-speech tag, h is a word-tag pair (cid.6)w, t(cid.7), and the rule rewrites to just the word w. (See Figure 2 for examples of lexical rules.)",4,0.7346938775510204,3,49,2003
"Formally, we will always take a lexicalized nonterminal P(h) to expand deterministically (with probability one) in this way if P is a part-of-speech symbol.",3,0.8870967741935484,3,31,2003
Thus for the parsing models we require the nonterminal labels to be partitioned into two sets.,2,0.8235294117647058,2,17,2003
part-of-speech symbols and other nonterminals.,2,0,2,6,2003
Internal rules always have an LHS in which P is not a part-of-speech symbol.,2,0.9333333333333333,3,15,2003
"Because lexicalized rules are deterministic, they will not be discussed in the remainder of this article.",2,0.8888888888888888,2,18,2003
All of the modeling choices concern internal rules.,2,0,2,9,2003
The probability of an internal rule can be rewritten (exactly) using the chain rule  of probabilities.,3,0.8157894736842105,2,19,2003
"In summary, the generation of the RHS of a rule such as (2), given the LHS, has  been decomposed into three steps.5  Generate the head constituent label of the phrase, with probability Ph(H | P, h).",3,0.8854166666666666,4,48,2003
"In this example, and in the examples in the rest of the article, for brevity we omit the part-of-speech tags associated with words, writing, for example S(bought) rather than S(bought,VBD).",4,0.8488372093023255,4,43,2003
"We emphasize that throughout the models in this article, each word is always paired with its part of speech, either when the word is generated or when the word is being conditioned upon.",4,1.0555555555555556,4,36,2003
Adding Distance to the Model.,1,0.9166666666666666,1,6,2003
In this section we rst describe how the model can be extended to be history-based. We then show how this extension can be utilized in incorporating distance features into the model.,2,1.3125,2,16,2003
Black et al.,1,0,1,4,2003
(1992) originally introduced history-based models for parsing.,2,0,1,10,2003
"Equations (3) and (4) of the current article made the independence assumption that each modier is generated independently of the others (i.e., that the modiers are generated independently of everything except P, H, and h).",3,0.8555555555555555,3,45,2003
"In general, however, the probability of generating each modier could depend on any function of the previous modiers, head/parent category, and headword.",3,0.7777777777777778,3,27,2003
"Moreover, if the top-down derivation order is fully specied, then the probability of generating a modier can be conditioned on any structure that has been previously generated.",3,0.9666666666666667,4,30,2003
The remainder of this article assumes that the derivation order is depth-rst.,2,0.9230769230769231,2,13,2003
"that is, each modier recursively generates the subtree below it before the next modier is generated.",2,0.7777777777777778,2,18,2003
(Figure 3 gives an example that illustrates this.),2,1.0,2,11,2003
"The models in Collins (1996) showed that the distance between words standing in head-modier relationships was important, in particular, that it is important to capture a preference for right-branching structures (which almost translates into a preference for dependencies between adjacent words) and a preference for dependencies not to cross a verb.",3,1.1293103448275863,3,58,2003
In this section we describe how this information can be incorporated into model 1.,2,1.0,2,15,2003
"In section 7.2, we describe experiments that evaluate the effect of these features on parsing accuracy.",2,1.1388888888888888,2,18,2003
A partially completed tree derived depth-rst.,2,0.7857142857142857,1,7,2003
???,0,1,1,1,2003
"? marks the position of the next modier to be generatedit could be a nonterminal/headword/head-tag triple, or the STOP symbol.",0,1,3,1,2003
"The distribution over possible symbols in this position could be conditioned on any previously generated structure, that is, any structure appearing in the gure.",2,0.9444444444444444,2,27,2003
"The next child, R3(r3), is generated with probability P(R3(r3) | P, H, h, distancer(2)).",4,0.828125,3,32,2003
The distance is a function of the surface string below previous modiers R1 and R2.,2,0.65625,2,16,2003
"In principle the model could condition on any structure dominated by H, R1, or R2 (or, for that matter, on any structure previously generated elsewhere in the tree).",4,0.7285714285714285,3,35,2003
Distance can be incorporated into the model by modifying the independence assumptions so that each modier has a limited dependence on the previous modiers.,2,0.82,2,25,2003
Here distancel and distancer are functions of the surface string below the previous modiers.,2,0.7666666666666667,2,15,2003
(See Figure 4 for illustration.),2,0.8125,2,8,2003
"The distance measure is similar to that in Collins (1996), a vector with the following two elements.",2,0.8333333333333334,3,21,2003
(1) Is the string of zero length?,2,0.75,1,10,2003
(2) Does the string contain a verb?,2,0.8,1,10,2003
The rst feature allows the model to learn a preference for right-branching structures.,2,0.8571428571428571,2,14,2003
The second feature6 allows the model to learn a preference for modication of the most recent verb.7  3.2 Model 2.,2,0.8181818181818182,2,22,2003
The Complement/Adjunct Distinction and Subcategorization The tree depicted in Figure 2 illustrates the importance of the complement/adjunct distinction.,2,0.8157894736842105,2,19,2003
"It would be useful to identify IBM as a subject and Last week as an adjunct (temporal modier), but this distinction is not made in the tree, as both NPs are in the same position8 (sisters to a VP under an S node).",3,0.74,4,50,2003
From here on we will identify complements9 by attaching a -C sufx to nonterminals.,2,1.0625,2,16,2003
Figure 5 shows the tree in Figure 2 with added complement markings.,2,0.7307692307692307,2,13,2003
"A postprocessing stage could add this detail to the parser output, but there are a couple of reasons for making the distinction while parsing.",3,0.75,2,26,2003
"First, identifying complements is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment.",2,0.8461538461538461,2,13,2003
"Lexical information is needed (for example, knowledge that week is likely to be a temporal modier).",2,1.075,3,20,2003
"Knowledge about subcategorization preferences (for example, that a verb takes exactly one subject) is also required.",3,1.125,2,20,2003
"For example, week can sometimes be a subject, as in Last week was a good one, so the model must balance the preference for having a subject against  6 Note that this feature means that dynamic programming parsing algorithms for the model must keep track of whether each constituent does or does not have a verb in the string to the right or left of its head.",2,0.9084507042253521,3,71,2003
See Collins (1999) for a full description of the parsing algorithms.,2,0.8928571428571429,2,14,2003
"7 In the models described in Collins (1997), there was a third question concerning punctuation.",3,1.0,2,19,2003
"(3) Does  the string contain 0, 1, 2 or more than 2 commas?",3,0.5833333333333334,3,18,2003
"(where a comma is anything tagged as , or .).",2,1.1666666666666667,2,12,2003
"The model described in this article has a cleaner incorporation of punctuation into the generative process, as described in section 4.3.",3,0.8260869565217391,2,23,2003
"8 Except that IBM is closer to the VP, but note that IBM is also the subject in IBM last week bought Lotus.",3,1.02,3,25,2003
9 We use the term complement in a broad sense that includes both complements and speciers under the  terminology of government and binding.,2,0.9791666666666666,2,24,2003
A tree with the -C sufx used to identify complements.,2,1.1666666666666667,1,12,2003
"IBM and Lotus are in subject and object position, respectively.",3,0.625,3,12,2003
Last week is an adjunct.,1,0.75,1,6,2003
"These problems are not restricted to NPs; compare The spokeswoman said (SBAR that the asbestos was dangerous) with Bonds beat short-term investments (SBAR because the market is down), in which an SBAR headed by that is a complement, but an SBAR headed by because is an adjunct.",6,0.9818181818181818,5,55,2003
A second reason for incorporating the complement/adjunct distinction into the parsing model is that this may help parsing accuracy.,2,1.0,2,20,2003
The assumption that complements are generated independently of one another often leads to incorrect parses.,2,1.34375,2,16,2003
(See Figure 6 for examples.),2,0.8125,2,8,2003
Identifying Complements and Adjuncts in the Penn Treebank.,2,0,2,9,2003
We add the -C sufx to all nonterminals in training data that satisfy the following conditions.,2,1.0,2,18,2003
The nonterminal must not have one of the following semantic tags.,2,0.7083333333333334,2,12,2003
"ADV, VOC, BNF, DIR, EXT, LOC, MNR, TMP, CLR or PRP.",7,0,2,20,2003
See Marcus et al.,1,1.1,2,5,2003
(1994) for an explanation of what these tags signify.,3,0,2,12,2003
"For example, the NP Last week in gure 2 would have the TMP (temporal) tag, and the SBAR in (SBAR because the market is down) would have the ADV (adverbial) tag.",4,0.75,4,40,2003
The nonterminal must not be on the RHS of a coordinated phrase.,2,0.7307692307692307,2,13,2003
"For example, in the rule S  S CC S, the two child Ss would not be marked as complements.",4,0.5909090909090909,2,22,2003
"In addition, the rst child following the head of a prepositional phrase is marked as a complement.",2,0.7631578947368421,3,19,2003
Probabilities over Subcategorization Frames.,1,0,1,5,2003
"Model 1 could be retrained on training data with the enhanced set of nonterminals, and it might learn the lexical properties that distinguish complements and adjuncts (IBM vs. week, or that vs. because).",4,0.9342105263157895,3,38,2003
"It would still suffer, however, from the bad independence assumptions illustrated in Figure 6.",2,0.9411764705882353,2,17,2003
"To solve these kinds of problems, the generative process is extended to include a probabilistic choice of left and right subcategorization frames.",3,0.7291666666666666,2,24,2003
Thus the subcategorization requirements are added to the conditioning context.,2,0.6818181818181818,2,11,2003
As complements are generated they are removed from the appropriate subcategorization multiset.,2,1.1153846153846154,2,13,2003
"Most importantly, the probability of generating the STOP symbol will be zero when the subcategorization frame is non-empty, and the probability of generating a particular complement will be zero when that complement is not in the subcategorization frame; thus all and only the required complements will be generated.",5,0.8557692307692307,4,52,2003
Here the head initially decides to take a single NP-C (subject) to its left and no complements to its right.,3,0.8260869565217391,2,23,2003
"NP-C(IBM) is immediately generated as the required subject, and NP-C is removed from LC, leaving it empty when the next modier, NP(week), is generated.",3,0.9,3,35,2003
"The incorrect structures in Figure 6 should now have low probability, because Plc({NP-C,NP-C} | S,VP,was) and Prc({NP-C,VP-C} | VP,VB,was) should be small.",5,0.9239130434782609,4,46,2003
Another obstacle to extracting predicate-argument structure from parse trees is whmovement.,2,1.0,2,12,2003
This section describes a probabilistic treatment of extraction from relative clauses.,2,0.7916666666666666,2,12,2003
"Noun phrases are most often extracted from subject position, object position, or from within PPs.",3,0.75,2,18,2003
It might be possible to write rule-based patterns that identify traces in a parse tree.,1,1.21875,2,16,2003
"We argue again, however, that this task is best integrated into the parser.",2,1.0625,3,16,2003
"The task is complex enough to warrant a probabilistic treatment, and integration may help parsing accuracy.",3,0.7777777777777778,2,18,2003
"A couple of complexities are that modication by an SBAR does not always involve extraction (e.g., the fact (SBAR that besoboru is played with a ball and a bat)), and it is not uncommon for extraction to occur through several constituents (e.g., The changes (SBAR that he said the government was prepared to make TRACE)).",4,1.0298507462686568,5,67,2003
One hope is that an integrated treatment of traces will improve the parameterization of the model.,2,0.9411764705882353,2,17,2003
"In particular, the subcategorization probabilities are smeared by extraction.",2,0.7727272727272727,2,11,2003
"In examples (1), (2), and (3), bought is a transitive verb; but without knowledge of traces, example (2) in training data will contribute to the probability of boughts being an intransitive verb.",5,1.065217391304348,4,46,2003
Formalisms similar to GPSG (Gazdar et al.,2,1,2,9,2003
1985) handle wh-movement by adding a gap feature to each nonterminal in the tree and propagating gaps through the tree until they are nally discharged as a trace complement (see Figure 7).,3,0.9166666666666666,3,36,2003
"In extraction cases the Penn Treebank annotation coindexes a TRACE with the WHNP head of the SBAR, so it is straightforward to add this information to trees in training data.",4,0.703125,2,32,2003
A +gap feature can be added to nonterminals to describe wh-movement.,2,1.1538461538461537,2,13,2003
The top-level NP initially generates an SBAR modier but species that it must contain an NP trace by adding the +gap feature.,2,0.8958333333333334,2,24,2003
"The gap is then passed down through the tree, until it is discharged as a TRACE complement to the right of bought.",2,0.9375,2,24,2003
"Given that the LHS of the rule has a gap, there are three ways that the gap can  be passed down to the RHS.",3,0.9423076923076923,3,26,2003
Head.,0,1,0,2,2003
"The gap is passed to the head of the phrase, as in rule (3) in Figure 7.",2,0.8333333333333334,2,21,2003
"Left, Right.",1,1,1,4,2003
The gap is passed on recursively to one of the left or right modiers of the head or is discharged as a TRACE argument to the left or right of the head.,3,0.7727272727272727,3,33,2003
"In rule (2) in Figure 7, it is passed on to a right modier, the S complement.",3,0.7954545454545454,2,22,2003
"In rule (4), a TRACE is generated to the right of the head VB.",2,0.8055555555555556,2,18,2003
"We specify a parameter type Pg(G| P, h, H) where G is either Head, Left, or Right.",3,0.8076923076923077,2,26,2003
The generative process is extended to choose among these cases after generating the head of the phrase.,2,0.9722222222222222,2,18,2003
The rest of the phrase is then generated in different ways depending on how the gap is propagated.,2,1.0,2,19,2003
In the Head case the left and right modiers are generated as normal.,2,0.6785714285714286,2,14,2003
In the Left and Right cases a +gap requirement is added to either the left or right SUBCAT variable.,3,0.7380952380952381,3,21,2003
"This requirement is fullled (and removed from the subcategorization list) when either a trace or a modier nonterminal that has the +gap feature, is generated.",3,0.9166666666666666,4,30,2003
"For example, rule (2) in Figure 7, SBAR(that)(+gap)  WHNP(that) S-C(bought)(+gap), has probability  In rule (2), Right is chosen, so the +gap requirement is added to RC.",5,0.8611111111111112,3,54,2003
Generation of S-C(bought)(+gap) fullls both the S-C and +gap requirements in RC.,3,0,3,21,2003
"In rule (4), Right is chosen again.",3,0.9545454545454546,2,11,2003
Note that generation of TRACE satises both the NP-C and +gap subcategorization requirements.,2,0.8333333333333334,4,15,2003
Linguistically Motivated Renements to the Models  Sections 3.1 to 3.3 described the basic framework for the parsing models in this article.,3,0,2,22,2003
"In this section we describe how some linguistic phenomena (nonrecursive NPs and coordination, for example) clearly violate the independence assumptions of the general models.",3,0.8214285714285714,4,28,2003
"We describe a number of these special cases, in each instance arguing that the phenomenon violates the independence assumptions, then describing how the model can be rened to deal with the problem.",3,0.9428571428571428,3,35,2003
"We dene nonrecursive NPs (from here on referred to as base-NPs and labeled NPB rather than NP) as NPs that do not directly dominate an NP themselves, unless the dominated NP is a possessive NP (i.e., it directly dominates a POS-tag POS).",4,0.9591836734693877,3,49,2003
Figure 8 gives some examples.,1,0.75,1,6,2003
Base-NPs deserve special treatment for three reasons.,1,0.9375,1,8,2003
"Because of this, the probability of generating the STOP symbol should be greatly increased when the previous modier is, for example, a determiner.",2,0.8703703703703703,3,27,2003
"As they stand, the independence assumptions in the three models lose this information.",3,0.8,2,15,2003
"As a result, the model will assign unreasonably high probabilities to NPs such as [NP yesterday the dog] in sentences such as Yesterday the dog barked.",3,0.8666666666666667,2,30,2003
The annotation standard in the treebank leaves the internal structure of base-NPs underspecied.,2,1.0,2,14,2003
"For example, both pet food volume (where pet modies food and food modies volume) and vanilla ice cream (where both vanilla and ice modify cream) would have the structure NPB  NN NN NN.",4,0.7692307692307693,5,39,2003
"Because of this, there is no reason to believe that modiers within NPBs are dependent on the head rather than the previous modier.",2,0.98,2,25,2003
"In fact, if it so happened that a majority of phrases were like pet food volume, then conditioning on the previous modier rather than the head would be preferable.",4,0.921875,5,32,2003
In general it is important (in particular for the distance measure to be effective) to have different nonterminal labels for what are effectively different X-bar levels.,3,1.0344827586206897,3,29,2003
(See section 7.3.2 for further discussion.),2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003
The nonterminal label for base-NPs is changed from NP to NPB.,2,0.9583333333333334,2,12,2003
"For consistency, whenever an NP is seen with no pre- or postmodiers, an NPB level is added.",4,0.8095238095238095,3,21,2003
"For example, [S [NP the dog] [VP barks] ] would be transformed into [S [NP [NPB the dog] ] [VP barks ] ].",3,0.8428571428571429,3,35,2003
These extra NPBs are removed before scoring the output of the parser against the treebank.,2,0.9375,2,16,2003
"For simplicity, we give probability terms under model 1 with no distance variables; the probability  terms with distance variables, or for models 2 and 3, will be similar, but with the addition of various pieces of conditioning information.",3,0,4,44,2003
"The modier and previous-modier nonterminals are always adjacent, so the distance variable is constant and is omitted.",3,0,2,19,2003
"For the purposes of this model, L0(l0) and R0(r0) are dened to be H(h).",3,1.0,3,25,2003
Coordination constructions are another example in which the independence assumptions in the basic models fail badly (at least given the current annotation method in the treebank).,3,0.8620689655172413,3,29,2003
The independence assumptions mean that the model fails to learn that there is always exactly one phrase following the coordinator (CC).,2,1.0,2,24,2003
The basic probability models will give much too high probabilities to unlikely phrases such as NP  NP CC or NP  NP CC NP NP.,2,0.54,2,25,2003
"For this reason we alter the generative process to allow generation of both the coordinator and the following phrase in one step; instead of just generating a nonterminal at each step, a nonterminal and a binary-valued coord ag are generated.",4,0.7906976744186046,3,43,2003
coord = 1 if there is a coordination relationship.,1,1.1,2,10,2003
"In the generative process, generation of a coord = 1 ag along with a modier triggers an additional step in the generative  (a) The generic way of annotating coordination in the treebank.",3,0.7638888888888888,3,36,2003
(b) and (c) show specic examples (with base-NPs added as described in section 4.1).,2,0.8809523809523809,2,21,2003
Note that the rst item of the conjunct is taken as the head of the phrase.,2,0.9411764705882353,3,17,2003
"Note the new type of parameter, Pcc, for the generation of the coordinator word and POS tag.",3,0.675,2,20,2003
The generation of coord=1 along with NP(dog) in the example implicitly requires generation of a coordinator tag/word pair through the Pcc parameter.,4,0.875,2,28,2003
"The generation of this tag/word pair is conditioned on the two words in the coordination dependency (man and dog in the example) and the label on their relationship (NP,NP,NP in the example, representing NP coordination).",3,0.7666666666666667,4,45,2003
"This section describes our treatment of punctuation in the model, where punctuation is used to refer to words tagged as a comma or colon.",2,1.0576923076923077,2,26,2003
"Previous workthe generative models described in Collins (1996) and the earlier version of these models described in Collins (1997)conditioned on punctuation as surface features of the string, treating it quite differently from lexical items.",3,0.8536585365853658,2,41,2003
"In particular, the model in Collins (1997) failed to generate punctuation, a deciency of the model.",2,1.0,2,21,2003
This section describes how punctuation is integrated into the generative models.,1,1.0,2,12,2003
Our rst step is to raise punctuation as high in the parse trees as possible.,2,0.9375,2,16,2003
"Punctuation at the beginning or end of sentences is removed from the training/test data altogether.13 All punctuation items apart from those tagged as comma or colon (items such as quotation marks and periods, tagged   or . )",4,0.875,3,40,2003
are removed altogether.,1,1.125,1,4,2003
"These transformations mean that punctuation always appears between two nonterminals, as opposed to appearing at the end of a phrase.",2,1.0454545454545454,2,22,2003
(See Figure 10 for an example.),2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003
A parse tree before and after punctuation transformations.,2,0,1,9,2003
"13 As one of the anonymous reviewers of this article pointed out, this choice of discarding the  sentence-nal punctuation may not be optimal, as the nal punctuation mark may well carry useful information about the sentence structure.",3,0.825,4,40,2003
Punctuation is then treated in a very similar way to coordination.,2,0.9583333333333334,2,12,2003
Our intuition is that there is a strong dependency between the punctuation mark and the modier generated after it.,2,0.9,2,20,2003
Punctuation is therefore generated with the following phrase through a punc ag that is similar to the coord ag (a binary-valued feature equal to one if a punctuation mark is generated with the following phrase).,2,0.9078947368421053,3,38,2003
Pp is a new parameter type for generation of punctuation tag/word pairs.,2,0.8076923076923077,2,13,2003
The generation of punc=1 along with ADJP(old) in the example implicitly requires generation of a punctuation tag/word pair through the Pp parameter.,4,0.875,2,28,2003
"The generation of this tag/word pair is conditioned on the two words in the punctuation dependency (Vinken and old in the example) and the label on their relationship (NP,NPB,ADJP in the example.)",4,0.7926829268292683,4,41,2003
Sentences in the treebank occur frequently with PRO subjects that may or may not be controlled.,2,0.9411764705882353,2,17,2003
"As the treebank annotation currently stands, the nonterminal is S whether or not a sentence has an overt subject.",3,0.7380952380952381,2,21,2003
This is a problem for the subcategorization probabilities in models 2 and 3.,2,0.75,2,14,2003
"The probability of having zero subjects, Plc({} | S, VP, verb), will be fairly high because of this.",4,0.7777777777777778,3,27,2003
"In addition, sentences with and without subjects appear in quite different syntactic environments.",2,0.7666666666666667,2,15,2003
For these reasons we modify the nonterminal for sentences without subjects to be SG (see gure 11).,3,1.075,2,20,2003
The resulting model has a cleaner division of subcategorization.,2,0.75,1,10,2003
"Plc({NP-C} | S, VP, verb)  1 and Plc({NP-C} | SG, VP, verb) = 0.",4,1.0,2,29,2003
The model will learn probabilistically the environments in which S and SG are likely to appear.,2,1.088235294117647,2,17,2003
"As a nal step, we use the rule concerning punctuation introduced in Collins (1996) to impose a constraint as follows.",2,1.0208333333333333,2,24,2003
"If for any constituent Z in the chart Z  <..X Y..> two of its children X and Y are separated by a comma, then the last word in Y must be directly followed by a comma, or must be the last word in the sentence.",2,0,2,11,2003
In training data 96% of commas follow this rule.,2,0.8636363636363636,1,11,2003
The rule has the benet of improving efciency by reducing the number of constituents in the chart.,2,1.1388888888888888,2,18,2003
"It would be preferable to develop a probabilistic analog of this rule, but we leave this to future research.",3,0.7857142857142857,3,21,2003
"(a) The treebank annotates sentences with empty subjects with an empty -NONE- element under subject position; (b) in training (and for evaluation), this null element is removed; (c) in models 2 and 3, sentences without subjects are changed to have a nonterminal SG.",4,0.9482758620689655,4,58,2003
5.1 Parameter Estimation Table 1 shows the various levels of back-off for each type of parameter in the model.,2,0.875,2,20,2003
"Note that we decompose PL(Li(lwi, lti), c, p | P, H, w, t, , LC) (where lwi and lti are the word and POS tag generated with nonterminal Li, c and p are the coord and punc ags associated with the nonterminal, and  is the distance measure) into the product  These two probabilities are then smoothed separately.",6,0.72,4,75,2003
Eisner (1996b) originally used POS tags to smooth a generative model in this way.,2,0.8823529411764706,2,17,2003
"In each case the nal estimate is  where e1, e2, and e3 are maximum-likelihood estimates with the context at levels 1, 2, and 3 in the table, and 1, 2 and 3 are smoothing parameters, where 0  i  1.",4,0.7978723404255319,4,47,2003
We use the smoothing method described in Bikel et al.,2,0.8636363636363636,2,11,2003
"(1997), which is derived from a method described in Witten and Bell (1991).",2,0.8947368421052632,2,19,2003
"First, say that the most specic estimate e1 = n1 ; that is, f1 is the value of the denominator count in the relative frequency f1 estimate.",4,0.5833333333333334,3,30,2003
"Second, dene u1 to be the number of distinct outcomes seen in the f1 events in training data.",2,0.875,2,20,2003

Table 7 shows the results for models 1 and 2 with and without the adjacency and verb distance measures.,3,0.625,2,20,2003
It is clear that the distance measure improves the models accuracy.,2,0.8333333333333334,2,12,2003
What is most striking is just how badly model 1 performs without the distance measure.,2,0.96875,2,16,2003
"Looking at the parsers output, the reason for this poor performance is that the adjacency condition in the distance measure is approximating subcategorization information.",3,0.6730769230769231,3,26,2003
"In particular, in phrases such as PPs and SBARs (and, to a lesser extent, in VPs) that almost always take exactly one complement to the right of their head, the adjacency feature encodes this monovalency through parameters P(STOP|PP/SBAR, adjacent) = 0 and P(STOP|PP/SBAR, not adjacent) = 1.",5,0.7424242424242424,3,66,2003

"One interpretation in moving from the least parameterized model (Model 1 [No, No]) to the fully parameterized model (Model 2 [Yes, Yes]) is that the adjacency condition adds around 11% in accuracy; the verb condition adds another 1.5%; and subcategorization nally adds a mere 0.8%.",7,0.819672131147541,3,61,2003
"Under this interpretation subcategorization information isnt all that useful (and this was my original assumption, as this was the order in which features were originally added to the model).",3,0.8939393939393939,3,33,2003
But under another interpretation subcategorization is very useful.,2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003
"In moving from Model 1 (No, No) to Model 2 (No, No), we see a 10% improvement as a result of subcategorization parameters; adjacency then adds a 1.5% improvement; and the verb condition adds a nal 1% improvement.",6,0.8333333333333334,3,51,2003
"From an engineering point of view, given a choice of whether to add just distance or subcategorization to the model, distance is preferable.",5,0.8461538461538461,3,26,2003

The distribution varies a great deal with distance.,2,0.7222222222222222,2,9,2003

7.2.3 Distance Features and Right-Branching Structures.,2,0,2,7,2003
Both the adjacency and verb components of the distance measure allow the model to learn a preference for rightbranching structures.,2,0.9047619047619048,2,21,2003
"First, consider the adjacency condition.",1,0.6428571428571429,1,7,2003
Figure 14 shows some examples in which right-branching structures are more frequent.,2,1.0,2,13,2003
"Using the statistics from Tables 8 and 9, the probability of the alternative structures can be calculated.",3,0,3,19,2003
The results are given below.,1,0.9166666666666666,1,6,2003
"The right-branching structures get higher probability (although this is before the lexical-dependency probabilities are multiplied in, so this prior preference for right-branching structures can be overruled by lexical preferences).",3,0.7575757575757576,3,33,2003
"If the distance variables were not conditioned on, the product of terms for the two alternatives would be identical, and the model would have no preference for one structure over another.",4,0.8235294117647058,2,34,2003
"Probabilities for the two alternative PP structures in Figure 14 (excluding probability terms that are constant across the two structures; A=1 means distance is adjacent, A=0 means not adjacent) are as follows.",4,1.024390243902439,3,41,2003
"Some alternative structures for the same surface sequence of chunks (NPB PP PP in the rst case, NPB PP SBAR in the second case) in which the adjacency condition distinguishes between the two structures.",3,0.6973684210526315,5,38,2003
The percentages are taken from sections 221 of the treebank.,1,0.8636363636363636,1,11,2003

Some alternative structures for the same surface sequence of chunks in which the verb condition in the distance measure distinguishes between the two structures.,3,0.92,3,25,2003
"In both cases the low-attachment analyses will get higher probability under the model, because of the low probability of generating a PP modier involving a dependency that crosses a verb.",2,0.90625,2,32,2003
(X stands for any nonterminal.),2,0.6875,2,8,2003
7.2.4 Verb Condition and Right-Branching Structures.,2,0,2,7,2003
Figure 15 shows some examples in which the verb condition is important in differentiating the probability of two structures.,2,1.25,2,20,2003
"In both cases an adjunct can attach either high or low, but high attachment results in a dependencys crossing a verb and has lower probability.",4,0.7407407407407407,2,27,2003
"An alternative to the surface string feature would be a predicate such as were any of the previous modiers in X, where X is a set of nonterminals that are likely to contain a verb, such as VP, SBAR, S, or SG.",3,1.0104166666666667,2,48,2003
This would allow the model to handle cases like the rst example in Figure 15 correctly.,2,0.9411764705882353,2,17,2003
The second example shows why it is preferable to condition on the surface string.,2,0.9333333333333333,2,15,2003
"In this case the verb is invisible to the top level, as it is generated recursively below the NP object.",2,0.8636363636363636,3,22,2003
7.2.5 Structural versus Semantic Preferences.,1,1,1,6,2003
One hypothesis would be that lexical statistics are really what is important in parsing.,2,1.1666666666666667,2,15,2003
"that arriving at a correct interpretation for a sentence is simply a matter of nding the most semantically plausible analysis, and that the statistics related to lexical dependencies approximate this notion of plausibility.",4,0.8857142857142857,3,35,2003
"Implicitly, we would be just as well off (maybe even better off) if statistics were calculated between items at the predicate-argument level, with no reference to structure.",3,0.90625,3,32,2003
The distance preferences under this interpretation are just a way of mitigating sparse-data problems.,2,0.9333333333333333,2,15,2003
"When the lexical statistics are too sparse, then falling back on some structural preference is not ideal, but is at least better than chance.",3,0.8703703703703703,2,27,2003

The model makes the correct predictions in these cases.,2,0.75,1,10,2003
"In example (4), the statistics in Table 9 show that a PP is nine times as likely to attach low as to attach high when two verbs are candidate attachment points (the chances of seeing a PP modier are 15.8% and 1.73% in columns 1 and 5 of the table, respectively).",3,0.9416666666666667,4,60,2003
"In example (5), the probability of seeing an NP (adjunct) modier to do in a nonadjacent but non-verbcrossing environment is 2.11% in sections 221 of the treebank (8 out of 379 cases); in contrast, the chance of seeing an NP adjunct modifying said across a verb is 0.026% (1 out of 3,778 cases).",4,0.8208955223880597,4,67,2003

"This section makes this point more explicit, describing exactly what annotation style is suitable for the models and showing how other annotation styles will cause problems.",3,0.9821428571428571,3,28,2003
This dependence on Penn Treebankstyle annotations does not imply that the models are inappropriate for a treebank annotated in a different style.,2,0.7391304347826086,2,23,2003
"In this case we simply recommend transforming the trees into at, one-levelper-X-bar-level trees before training the model, as in the three-step procedure outlined above.",3,0.8703703703703703,4,27,2003
Other models in the literature are also very likely to be sensitive to annotation style.,2,0.9375,2,16,2003
"Charniaks (1997) models will most likely perform quite differently with binarybranching trees (for example, his current models will learn that rules such as VP  V SG PP are very rare, but with binary-branching structures, this context sensitivity will be lost).",4,0.7083333333333334,4,48,2003
The models of Magerman (1995) and Ratnaparkhi (1997) use contextual predicates that would most likely need to be modied given a different annotation style.,2,1.0344827586206897,3,29,2003
"Goodmans (1997) models are the exception, as he already species that the treebank should be transformed into his chosen representation, binary-branching trees.",2,0.7777777777777778,3,27,2003
"7.3.1 Representation Affects Structural, not Lexical, Preferences.",2,0.85,1,10,2003
"The alternative representations in Figures 16 and 17 have the same lexical dependencies (providing that the binary-branching structures are centered about the head of the phrase, as in the examples).",3,0.7058823529411765,4,34,2003
The difference between the representations involves structural preferences such as the right-branching preferences encoded by the distance measure.,2,0.7631578947368421,2,19,2003
Applying the models in this article to treebank analyses that use this type of head-centered  BB = binary-branching structures; FLAT = Penn treebank style annotations.,2,0.9259259259259259,2,27,2003
In each case the binary-branching annotation style prevents the model from learning that these structures should receive low probability because of the long distance dependency associated with the nal PP (in boldface).,3,0.7285714285714285,2,35,2003
binary-branching tree will result in a distance measure that incorrectly encodes a preference for right-branching structures.,2,1.0,2,17,2003
"To see this, consider the examples in Figure 18.",2,0.8636363636363636,1,11,2003
"In each binary-branching example, the generation of the nal modifying PP is blind to the distance between it and the head that it modies.",3,0.8076923076923077,3,26,2003
"At the top level of the tree, it is apparently adjacent to the head; crucially, the closer modier (SG in (a), the other PP in (b)) is hidden lower in the tree structure.",4,0.7159090909090909,4,44,2003
"So the model will be unable to differentiate generation of the PP in adjacent versus nonadjacent or non-verb-crossing versus verb-crossing environments, and the structures in Figure 18 will be assigned unreasonably high probabilities.",4,0.8142857142857143,4,35,2003
This does not mean that distance preferences cannot be encoded in a binarybranching PCFG.,2,0.8125,3,16,2003
Goodman (1997) achieves this by adding distance features to the nonterminals.,2,1.0,2,14,2003
"The spirit of this implementation is that the top-level rules VP  VP PP and NP  NP PP would be modied to VP  VP(+rverb) PP and NP  NP(+rmod) PP, respectively, where (+rverb) means a phrase in which the head has a verb in its right modiers, and (+rmod) means a phrase that has at least one right modier to the head.",4,0.9358974358974359,5,78,2003
"The model will learn from training data that P(VP  VP(+rverb) PP|VP) (cid.17) P(VP  VP(-rverb) PP|VP), that is, that a prepositional-phrase modication is much more likely when it does not cross a verb.",4,0.8839285714285714,3,56,2003
7.3.2 The Importance of Differentiating Nonrecursive from Recursive NPs.,2,0,1,10,2003
Figure 19 shows the modication to the Penn Treebank annotation to relabel base-NPs as NPB.,2,0.8125,2,16,2003
It also illustrates a problem that arises if a distinction between the two is not made.,2,1.1470588235294117,3,17,2003
Structures such as that in Figure 19(b) are assigned high probabilities even if they  Examples of other phrases in the Penn Treebank in which nonrecursive and recursive phrases are not differentiated.,2,1.0285714285714285,4,35,2003

"(Johnson [1997] notes that this structure has a higher probability than the correct, at structure, given counts taken from the treebank for a standard PCFG.)",3,0.71875,3,32,2003
"The model is fooled by the binary-branching style into modeling both PPs as being adjacent to the head of the noun phrase, so 19(b) will be assigned a very high probability.",4,0.7361111111111112,4,36,2003
This problem does not apply only to NPs.,2,0.8333333333333334,1,9,2003
"Other types of phrases such as adjectival phrases (ADJPs) or adverbial phrases (ADVPs) also have nonrecursive (bar 1) and recursive (bar 2) levels, which are not differentiated in the Penn Treebank.",4,0.8536585365853658,3,41,2003
(See Figure 20 for examples.),2,0.8125,2,8,2003
Ideally these cases should be differentiated too.,1,0.9375,1,8,2003
"We did not implement this change because it is unlikely to make much difference in accuracy, given the relative infrequency of these cases (excluding coordination cases, and looking at the 80,254 instances in sections 221 of the Penn Treebank in which a parent and head nonterminal are the same.",3,0.8207547169811321,3,53,2003
94.5% are the NP case; 2.6% are cases of coordination in which a punctuation mark is the coordinator;18 only 2.9% are similar to those in Figure 20).,3,0.7571428571428571,3,35,2003

"As shown in this section, many test data sentences will require rules that have not been seen in training.",2,0.9761904761904762,2,21,2003
This gives motivation for breaking down rules into smaller components.,2,1.0909090909090908,2,11,2003
This section motivates the need to break down rules from four perspectives.,2,0.9230769230769231,2,13,2003

7.4.1 The Penn Treebank Annotation Style Leads to Many Rules.,2,0.6818181818181818,1,11,2003
"The atness of the Penn Treebank annotation style has already been discussed, in section 7.3.",2,0.6764705882352942,2,17,2003
"The atness of the trees leads to a very large (and constantly growing) number of rules, primarily because the number of adjuncts to a head is potentially unlimited.",3,0.90625,3,32,2003
"For example, there can be any number of PP adjuncts to a head verb.",2,1.0,2,16,2003
A binary-branching (Chomsky adjunction) grammar can generate an unlimited number of adjuncts with very few rules.,2,0.868421052631579,2,19,2003
"For example, the following grammar generates any sequence VP  V NP PP*.",3,0.7,2,15,2003
"Other adverbial adjuncts, such as adverbial phrases or adverbial SBARs, can also modify a verb several times, and all of these different types of adjuncts can be seen together in the same rule.",3,0.7702702702702703,3,37,2003
The result is a combinatorial explosion in the number of rules.,2,0.875,1,12,2003
"To give a avor of this, here is a random sample of rules of the format VP  VB modifier* that occurred only once in sections 221 of the Penn Treebank.",3,0.8333333333333334,3,33,2003
It is not only verb phrases that cause this kind of combinatorial explosion.,2,1.25,2,14,2003
"Other phrases, in particular nonrecursive noun phrases, also contribute a huge number of rules.",3,0.6764705882352942,2,17,2003
The next section considers the distributional properties of the rules in more detail.,2,0.75,2,14,2003
"Note that there is good motivation for the Penn Treebanks decision to represent rules in this way, rather than with rules expressing Chomsky adjunction (i.e., a schema in which complements and adjuncts are separated, through rule types (cid.6)VP  VB {complement}*(cid.7) and (cid.6)VP  VP {adjunct}(cid.7)).",4,0.9225352112676056,3,71,2003
"First, it allows the argument/adjunct distinction for PP modiers to verbs to be left undened.",2,1.0294117647058822,3,17,2003
This distinction was found to be very difcult for annotators.,1,1.0,1,11,2003
"Second, in the surface ordering (as opposed to deep structure), adjuncts are often found closer to the head than complements, thereby yielding structures that fall outside the Chomsky adjunction schema.",3,1.0138888888888888,3,36,2003
"For example, a rule such as (cid.6)VP  VB NP-C PP SBAR-C(cid.7) is found very frequently in the Penn Treebank; SBAR complements nearly always extrapose over adjuncts.",4,0,3,37,2003
7.4.2 Quantifying the Coverage Problem.,1,0,1,6,2003
"To quantify the coverage problem, rules were collected from sections 221 of the Penn Treebank.",2,0,2,17,2003
"Punctuation was raised as high as possible in the tree, and the rules did not have complement markings or the distinction between base-NPs and recursive NPs.",3,0,2,28,2003
"Under these conditions, 939,382 rule tokens were collected; there were 12,409 distinct rule types.",3,0,2,17,2003
We also collected the count for each rule.,2,0.8333333333333334,1,9,2003
Table 10 shows some statistics for these rules.,1,0.8333333333333334,1,9,2003
"A majority of rules in the grammar (6,765, or 54.5%) occur only once.",3,0.8611111111111112,2,18,2003
These rules account for 0.72% of rules by token.,2,0.9545454545454546,2,11,2003
"That is, if one of the 939,382 rule tokens in sections 221 of the treebank were drawn at random, there would be a 0.72% chance of its being the only instance of that rule in the 939,382 tokens.",3,0.8452380952380952,3,42,2003
"On the other hand, if a rule were drawn at random from the 12,409 rules in the grammar induced from those sections, there would be a 54.5% chance of that rules having occurred only once.",4,0.8589743589743589,3,39,2003
The percentage by token of the one-count rules is an indication of the coverage problem.,2,0.84375,2,16,2003
"From this estimate, 0.72% of all rules (or 1 in 139 rules) required in test data would never have been seen in training.",3,0.875,4,28,2003
It was also found that 15.0% (1 in 6.67) of all sentences have at least one rule that occurred just once.,3,1.06,3,25,2003
"This gives an estimate that roughly 1 in 6.67 sentences in test data will not be covered by a grammar induced from 40,000 sentences in the treebank.",2,1.0357142857142858,3,28,2003
"If the complement markings are added to the nonterminals, and the base-NP/nonrecursive NP distinction is made, then the coverage problem is made worse.",5,0.6538461538461539,3,26,2003
Table 11 gives the statistics in this case.,1,0.8333333333333334,2,9,2003

Parsing experiments were used to assess the impact of the coverage problem on parsing accuracy.,2,1.03125,2,16,2003
"Section 0 of the treebank was parsed with models 1 and 2 as before, but the parse trees were restricted to include rules already seen in training data.",3,0.75,2,30,2003
Table 12 shows the results.,1,0.75,1,6,2003
"Restricting the rules leads to a 0.5% decrease in recall and a 1.6% decrease in precision for model 1, and a 0.9% decrease in recall and a 2.0% decrease in precision for model 2.",3,0,4,40,2003
7.4.4 Breaking Down Rules Improves Estimation.,2,1.0714285714285714,0,7,2003
Coverage problems are not the only motivation for breaking down rules.,2,0.9166666666666666,2,12,2003
The method may also improve estimation.,1,0.9285714285714286,1,7,2003
"To see this, consider the rules headed by told, whose counts are shown in Table 13.",2,1.0789473684210527,2,19,2003
"Estimating the probability P(Rule | VP, told) using Charniaks (1997) method would interpolate two maximum-likelihood estimates.",4,0.9130434782608695,3,23,2003
"Estimation interpolates between the specic, lexically sensitive distribution in Table 13 and the nonlexical estimate based on just the parent nonterminal, VP.",3,0.78,3,25,2003

From these statistics  would have to be relatively low.,2,1.1,2,10,2003
This estimation method is missing a crucial generalization.,2,0.6111111111111112,1,9,2003
"In spite of there being many different rules, the distribution over subcategorization frames is much sharper.",3,0.9444444444444444,2,18,2003
Told is seen with only ve subcategorization frames in training data.,2,0.7083333333333334,2,12,2003
The large number of rules is almost entirely due to adjuncts or punctuation appearing after or between complements.,2,0.9736842105263158,2,19,2003

"In summary, from the distributions in Table 13, the model should be quite uncertain about what rules told can appear with.",3,1.0208333333333333,3,24,2003
"It should be relatively certain, however, about the subcategorization frame.",2,0.8076923076923077,3,13,2003
Introducing subcategorization parameters allows the model to generalize in an important way about rules.,2,0.8666666666666667,2,15,2003
We have carefully isolated the core of rulesthe subcategorization framethat the model should be certain about.,2,1.0,2,17,2003
We should note that Charniaks method will certainly have some advantages in estimation.,2,1.0714285714285714,2,14,2003

An initial modelin fact Model 2 described in the current articleis used to generate N-best output.,2,0.8235294117647058,2,17,2003
The reranking approach attempts to rerank the N-best lists using additional features that are not used in the initial model.,2,0.9523809523809523,2,21,2003
The intention of this approach is to allow greater exibility in the features that can be included in the model.,2,1.0714285714285714,2,21,2003
"Finally, Bod (2001) describes a very different approach (a DOP approach to parsing) that gives excellent results on treebank parsing, comparable to the results of Charniak (2000) and Collins (2000).",3,0.8536585365853658,4,41,2003
We now give a more detailed comparison of the models in this article to the parser of Charniak (1997).,2,0.8863636363636364,2,22,2003
The model described in Charniak (1997) has two types of parameters.,2,0.9642857142857143,1,14,2003
This nonterminal could expand with any of the rules S   in the grammar.,2,0.8928571428571429,2,14,2003
"The rule probability is dened as P(S  |rose, S, VP).",2,0.8823529411764706,2,17,2003
"So the rule probability depends on the nonterminal being expanded, its headword, and also its parent.",4,0.6578947368421053,2,19,2003
The next few sections give further explanation of the differences between Charniaks models and the models in this article.,2,0.775,2,20,2003
8.1.1 Additional Features of Charniaks Model.,2,0,1,7,2003
There are some notable additional features of Charniaks model.,2,0.75,2,10,2003
"First, the rule probabilities are conditioned on the parent of the nonterminal being expanded.",2,0.84375,2,16,2003
"Our models do not include this information, although distinguishing recursive from nonrecursive NPs can be considered a reduced form of this information.",2,0.7291666666666666,3,24,2003
(See section 7.3.2 for a discussion of this distinction; the arguments in that section are also motivation for Charniaks choice of conditioning on the parent.),3,0.9310344827586207,2,29,2003
"Second, Charniak uses word-class information to smooth probabilities and reports a 0.35% improvement from this feature.",3,0.8421052631578947,3,19,2003
"Finally, Charniak uses 30 million words of text for unsupervised training.",2,0.9615384615384616,2,13,2003
A parser is trained from the treebank and used to parse this text; statistics are then collected from this machine-parsed text and merged with the treebank statistics to train a second model.,3,0.7647058823529411,3,34,2003
This gives a 0.5% improvement in performance.,2,0.9444444444444444,2,9,2003
8.1.2 The Dependency Parameters of Charniaks Model.,2,0,1,8,2003
"Though similar to ours, Charniaks dependency parameters are conditioned on less information.",2,0.8214285714285714,2,14,2003
"As noted previously, whereas our parameters are PL2(lwi | Li, lti, c, p, P, H, w, t, , LC), Charniaks parameters in our notation would be PL2(lwi | Li, P, w).",6,0.63,3,50,2003
The additional information included in our models is as follows.,2,1.0454545454545454,1,11,2003
H The head nonterminal label (VP in the previous prots/rose example).,2,0,1,14,2003
At rst glance this might seem redundant.,2,0.9375,1,8,2003
"For example, an S will usually take a VP as its head.",2,0.75,2,14,2003
"In some cases, however, the head label can vary.",3,0.625,3,12,2003
"For example, an S can take another S as its head in coordination cases.",2,0.78125,2,16,2003
"lti, t The POS tags for the head and modier words.",2,0,2,13,2003
Inclusion of these tags allows our models to use POS tags as word class information.,2,0.875,2,16,2003
Charniaks model may be missing an important generalization in this respect.,2,0.7916666666666666,2,12,2003
Charniak (2000) shows that using the POS tags as word class information in the model is important for parsing accuracy.,2,0.9130434782608695,3,23,2003
8.1.3 The Rule Parameters of Charniaks Model.,2,0,1,8,2003
"The rule parameters in Charniaks model are effectively decomposed into our L1 parameters (section 5.1), the head parameters, andin models 2 and 3the subcategorization and gap parameters.",4,0.578125,3,32,2003
This decomposition allows our model to assign probability to rules not seen in training data.,2,0.9375,2,16,2003
See section 7.4 for an extensive discussion.,1,0.8125,2,8,2003
8.1.4 Right-Branching Structures in Charniaks Model.,2,0,2,7,2003
Our models use distance features to encode preferences for right-branching structures.,1,1.0,2,12,2003
Charniaks model does not represent this information explicitly but instead learns it implicitly through rule probabilities.,3,0.7941176470588235,2,17,2003
"For example, for an NP PP PP sequence, the preference for a right-branching structure is encoded through a much higher probability for the rule NP  NP PP than for the rule NP  NP PP PP.",3,0.5394736842105263,4,38,2003
(Note that conditioning on the rules parent is needed to disallow the structure [NP [NP PP] PP]; see Johnson [1997] for further discussion.),4,0.8939393939393939,3,33,2003
This strategy does not encode all of the information in the distance measure.,2,0.8214285714285714,2,14,2003
The distance measure effectively penalizes rules NP  NPB NP PP where the middle NP contains a verb.,2,0.8611111111111112,3,18,2003
In this case the PP modication results in a dependency that crosses a verb.,2,1.1,2,15,2003
"Charniaks model is unable to distinguish cases in which the middle NP contains a verb (i.e., the PP modication crosses a verb) from those in which it does not.",3,1.196969696969697,3,33,2003
8.2 A Comparison to the Models of Jelinek et al.,2,1,2,11,2003
"(1994), Magerman (1995), and Rat naparkhi (1997)  We now make a detailed comparison of our models to the history-based models of Ratnaparkhi (1997), Jelinek et al.",3,0.881578947368421,3,38,2003
"(1994), and Magerman (1995).",2,0,2,10,2003
A strength of these models is undoubtedly the powerful estimation techniques that they use.,2,0.8666666666666667,2,15,2003
maximum-entropy modeling (in Ratnaparkhi 1997) or decision trees (in Jelinek et al.,3,0,2,16,2003
1994 and Magerman 1995).,2,0.9166666666666666,1,6,2003
"A weakness, we will argue in this section, is the method of associating parameters with transitions taken by bottom-up, shift-reduce-style parsers.",2,0.94,3,25,2003
We give examples in which this method leads to the parameters unnecessarily fragmenting the training data in some cases or ignoring important context in other cases.,2,0.9629629629629629,3,27,2003
"Similar observations have been made in the context of tagging problems using maximum-entropy models (Lafferty, McCallum, and Pereira 2001; Klein and Manning 2002).",2,0.8103448275862069,3,29,2003
We rst analyze the model of Magerman (1995) through three common examples of ambiguity.,2,0.9705882352941176,2,17,2003
"PP attachment, coordination, and appositives.",2,0,2,8,2003
"This is justied for the examples in this section, because once the jth decision is made, the following decisions are practically deterministic.",4,0.66,4,25,2003
"Equivalently, we are assuming that P(T1|S) + P(T2|S)  1, that is, that very little probability mass is lost to trees other than T1 or T2.",3,0.9615384615384616,3,39,2003
"Given these two equalities, we have isolated the decision between the two structures to the parameters P(dj|d1 .",2,0.8043478260869565,2,23,2003

Figure 21 shows a case of PP attachment.,1,0.8333333333333334,1,9,2003
The rst thing to note is that the PP attachment decision is made before the PP is even built.,2,0.875,3,20,2003
The decision is linked to the NP preceding the preposition.,1,0.8636363636363636,2,11,2003
whether the arc above the NP should go left or right.,2,0.7083333333333334,2,12,2003
"The next thing to note is that at least one important feature, the verb, falls outside of the conditioning context.",3,0.8913043478260869,3,23,2003
(The model considers only information up to two constituents preceding or following the location of the decision.),3,0.7,2,20,2003
"This could be repaired by considering additional context, but there is no xed bound on how far the verb can be from the decision point.",3,0.9444444444444444,2,27,2003
Note also that in other cases the method fragments the data in unnecessary ways.,2,0.9666666666666667,3,15,2003
"Cases in which the verb directly precedes the NP, or is one place farther to the left, are treated separately.",3,0.9565217391304348,2,23,2003
"Figure 22 shows a similar example, NP coordination ambiguity.",2,0.5909090909090909,2,11,2003
"Again, the pivotal decision is made in a somewhat counterintuitive location.",2,0.6538461538461539,2,13,2003
at the NP preceding the coordinator.,1,0.9285714285714286,2,7,2003
"At this point the NP following the coordinator has not been built, and its head noun is not in the contextual window.",3,0.6041666666666666,2,24,2003
Figure 23 shows an appositive example in which the head noun of the appositive NP is not in the contextual window when the decision is made.,2,0.8703703703703703,3,27,2003
These last two examples can be extended to illustrate another problem.,2,0.8333333333333334,1,12,2003
The NP after the conjunct or comma could be the subject of a following clause.,2,0.71875,2,16,2003
"For example,  (a) and (b) are two candidate structures for the same sequence of words.",3,0.7380952380952381,2,21,2003
(c) shows the rst decision (labeled ?) where the two structures differ.,1,1.0454545454545454,2,11,2003
"The arc above the NP can go either left (for verb attachment of the PP, as in (a)) or right (for noun attachment of the PP, as in (b)).",4,0.925,4,40,2003
(a) and (b) are two candidate structures for the same sequence of words.,2,0.75,2,18,2003
(c) shows the rst decision (labeled ?) where the two structures differ.,1,1.0454545454545454,2,11,2003
The arc above the NP can go either left (for high attachment (a) of the coordinated phrase) or right (for low attachment (b) of the coordinated phrase).,4,0.9027777777777778,3,36,2003
(a) and (b) are two candidate structures for the same sequence of words.,2,0.75,2,18,2003
(c) shows the rst decision (labeled ?) in which the two structures differ.,1,1.0454545454545454,2,11,2003
The arc above the NP can go either left (for high attachment (a) of the appositive phrase) or right (for noun attachment (b) of the appositive phrase).,4,0.875,3,36,2003
"in John likes Mary and Bill loves Jill, the decision not to coordinate Mary and Bill is made just after the NP Mary is built.",2,0.9629629629629629,3,27,2003
"At this point, the verb loves is outside the contextual window, and the model has no way of telling that Bill is the subject of the following clause.",3,0.8225806451612904,2,31,2003
The model is assigning probability mass to globally implausible structures as a result of points of local ambiguity in the parsing process.,3,0.8478260869565217,2,23,2003
Some of these problems can be repaired by changing the derivation order or the conditioning context.,2,0.8823529411764706,2,17,2003
"Ratnaparkhi (1997) has an additional chunking stage, which means that the head noun does fall within the contextual window for the coordination and appositive cases.",2,0.8793103448275862,2,29,2003
The models in this article incorporate parameters that track a number of linguistic phenomena.,2,1.1333333333333333,1,15,2003
"bigram lexical dependencies, subcategorization frames, the propagation of slash categories, and so on.",3,0.5588235294117647,2,17,2003
The models are generative models in which parse trees are decomposed into a number of steps in a top-down derivation of the tree  and the decisions in the derivation are modeled as conditional probabilities.,3,0.9714285714285714,3,35,2003
"With a careful choice of derivation and independence assumptions, the resulting model has parameters corresponding to the desired linguistic phenomena.",3,0.6136363636363636,2,22,2003
"In addition to introducing the three parsing models and evaluating their performance on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, we have aimed in our discussion (in sections 7 and 8) to give more insight into the models.",4,0.7195121951219512,3,41,2003
"their strengths and weaknesses, the effect of various features on parsing accuracy, and the relationship of the models to other work on statistical parsing.",3,0,3,27,2003
"In conclusion, we would like to highlight the following points.",2,0.9166666666666666,2,12,2003
"Section 7.1 showed, through an analysis of accuracy on different types of dependencies, that adjuncts are the main sources of error in the parsing models.",3,0.8928571428571429,3,28,2003
"In contrast, dependencies forming the core structure of sentences (for example, dependencies involving complements, sentential heads, and NP chunks) are all recovered with over 90% precision and recall.",3,0.8194444444444444,5,36,2003
Section 7.2 evaluated the effect of the distance measure on parsing accuracy.,2,0.9230769230769231,2,13,2003
"A model without either the adjacency distance feature or subcategorization parameters performs very poorly (76.5% precision, 75% recall), suggesting that the adjacency feature is capturing some subcategorization information in the model 1 parser.",3,0.6625,3,40,2003
"The results in Table 7 show that the subcategorization, adjacency, and verb-crossing features all contribute signicantly to model 2s (and by implication model 3s) performance.",3,0.8333333333333334,4,30,2003
"Section 7.3 described how the three models are well-suited to the Penn Treebank style of annotation, and how certain phenomena (particularly the distance features) may fail to be modeled correctly given treebanks with different annotation styles.",3,0.925,4,40,2003
This may be an important point to bear in mind when applying the models to other treebanks or other languages.,2,0.9761904761904762,2,21,2003

"Section 7.4 gave evidence showing the importance of the models ability to break down the context-free rules in the treebank, thereby generalizing to produce new rules on test examples.",3,0.9354838709677419,3,31,2003
Table 12 shows that precision on section 0 of the treebank decreases from 89.0% to 87.0% and recall decreases from 88.8% to 87.9% when the model is restricted to produce only those context-free rules seen in training data.,4,0.8255813953488372,3,43,2003
