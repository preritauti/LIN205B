Head-Driven Statistical Models for Natural Language Parsing  Michael Collins MIT Computer Science and Articial Intelligence Laboratory  This article describes three statistical models for natural language parsing.,3.4814814814814814,0.6481481481481481,1.6129032258064515,27,2003
"The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.",2.8947368421052633,0.9078947368421053,3.25,38,2003
"Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment.",7.323529411764706,1.0147058823529411,2.9210526315789473,34,2003
All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.,2.0,1.0384615384615385,1.8461538461538463,13,2003
"The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature.",3.0,0.78,3.12,25,2003
"To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.",4.090909090909091,0.803030303030303,2.7142857142857144,33,2003

"Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models.",2.3125,1.09375,2.71875,32,2003
Ambiguity is a central problem in natural language parsing.,2.1,0.75,2.1,10,2003
Combinatorial effects mean that even relatively short sentences can receive a considerable number of parses under a wide-coverage grammar.,2.65,0.75,3.090909090909091,20,2003
"Statistical parsing approaches tackle the ambiguity problem by assigning a probability to each parse tree, thereby ranking competing trees in order of plausibility.",2.64,0.9,2.92,25,2003
"In many statistical models the probability for each candidate tree is calculated as a product of terms, each term corresponding to some substructure within the tree.",2.5714285714285716,0.8392857142857143,2.8214285714285716,28,2003
The choice of parameterization is essentially the choice of how to represent parse trees.,2.2,1.1333333333333333,2.066666666666667,15,2003
There are two critical questions regarding the parameterization of a parsing approach.,2.1538461538461537,0.8076923076923077,2.230769230769231,13,2003
1.,0.5,1.25,0.5,2,2003
"Which linguistic objects (e.g., context-free rules, parse moves) should the  models parameters be associated with?",3.05,1.125,2.875,20,2003
"In other words, which features should be used to discriminate among alternative parse trees?",2.4375,1.03125,2.625,16,2003
How can this choice be instantiated in a sound probabilistic model?,2.1666666666666665,0.6666666666666666,2.5,12,2003
"In this article we explore these issues within the framework of generative models, more precisely, the history-based models originally introduced to parsing by Black.",5.666666666666667,0.7037037037037037,2.9310344827586206,27,2003
"In a history-based model, a parse tree is represented as a sequence of decisions, the decisions being made in some derivation of the tree.",2.6296296296296298,0.7962962962962963,2.9655172413793105,27,2003
"Each decision has an associated probability, and the product of these probabilities denes a probability distribution over possible derivations.",3.1904761904761907,0.5714285714285714,2.5714285714285716,21,2003
We rst describe three parsing models based on this approach.,2.090909090909091,1.0,2.0,11,2003
The models were originally introduced in Collins (1997); the current article1 gives considerably more detail about the models and discusses them in greater depth.,3.4285714285714284,0.7142857142857143,2.7142857142857144,28,2003
In Model 1 we show one approach that extends methods from probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) to lexicalized grammars.,2.7142857142857144,1.0,2.869565217391304,21,2003
"Most importantly, the model has parameters corresponding to dependencies between pairs of headwords.",2.2666666666666666,1.0333333333333334,1.8,15,2003
"We also show how to incorporate a distance measure into these models, by generalizing the model to a history-based approach.",2.8181818181818183,0.8863636363636364,3.576923076923077,22,2003
"The distance measure allows the model to learn a preference for close attachment, or right-branching structures.",3.611111111111111,0.7777777777777778,2.4,18,2003
"In Model 2, we extend the parser to make the complement/adjunct distinction, which will be important for most applications using the output from the parser.",2.6785714285714284,0.9285714285714286,2.6,28,2003
Model 2 is also extended to have parameters corresponding directly to probability distributions over subcategorization frames for headwords.,2.1052631578947367,1.105263157894737,2.210526315789474,19,2003
The new parameters lead to an improvement in accuracy.,2.1,0.85,1.6,10,2003
In Model 3 we give a probabilistic treatment of wh-movement that is loosely based on the analysis of wh-movement in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al.,2.78125,0.984375,3.2777777777777777,32,2003
1985).,1.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,3,2003
The output of the parser is now enhanced to show trace coindexations in wh-movement cases.,2.3125,0.9375,2.1666666666666665,16,2003
"The parameters in this model are interesting in that they correspond directly to the probability of propagating GPSG-style slash features through parse trees, potentially allowing the model to learn island constraints.",2.909090909090909,1.121212121212121,3.0285714285714285,33,2003
"In the three models a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree.",2.76,0.74,3.0,25,2003
"Independence assumptions then follow naturally, leading to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment.",4.055555555555555,1.0,2.5,36,2003
All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads.,2.0,1.0384615384615385,1.8461538461538463,13,2003
For this reason we refer to the models as head-driven statistical models.,2.3076923076923075,0.8076923076923077,2.2666666666666666,13,2003
"We describe evaluation of the three models on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",3.3333333333333335,0.6875,2.875,24,2003
"Model 1 achieves 87.7% constituent precision and 87.5% consituent recall on sentences of up to 100 words in length in section 23 of the treebank, and Models 2 and 3 give further improvements to 88.3% constituent precision and 88.0% constituent recall.",5.595744680851064,0.6808510638297872,3.6808510638297873,47,2003
These results are competitive with those of other models that have been applied to parsing the Penn Treebank.,2.1052631578947367,1.0789473684210527,2.263157894736842,19,2003
Models 2 and 3 produce trees with information about wh-movement or subcategorization.,2.3846153846153846,0.6923076923076923,2.466666666666667,13,2003
Many NLP applications will need this information to extract predicate-argument structure from parse trees.,2.3333333333333335,0.7,2.4705882352941178,15,2003
The rest of the article is structured as follows.,2.2,1.1,1.7,10,2003
Section 2 gives background material on probabilistic context-free grammars and describes how rules can be lexicalized through the addition of headwords to parse trees.,2.76,1.1,4.068965517241379,25,2003
Section 3 introduces the three probabilistic models.,2.125,0.5625,2.25,8,2003
Section 4 describes various renments to these models.,2.0,0.7222222222222222,2.0,9,2003
"Section 5 discusses issues of parameter estimation, the treatment of unknown words, and also the parsing algorithm.",3.95,0.725,3.3,20,2003
"Section 6 gives results evaluating the performance of the models on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993).",3.185185185185185,0.7222222222222222,2.740740740740741,27,2003
Section 7 investigates various aspects of the models in more detail.,2.0,0.875,1.9166666666666667,12,2003
"We give a  Head-Driven Statistical Models for NL Parsing  detailed analysis of the parsers performance on treebank data, including results on different constituent types.",3.4615384615384617,0.7115384615384616,3.0,26,2003
We also give a breakdown of precision and recall results in recovering various types of dependencies.,2.823529411764706,1.0,2.4705882352941178,17,2003
The intention is to give a better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of the parsing models.,2.4444444444444446,0.7777777777777778,2.3333333333333335,18,2003
"Section 7 goes on to discuss the distance features in the models, the implicit assumptions that the models make about the treebank annotation style, and the way that context-free rules in the original treebank are broken down, allowing the models to generalize by producing new rules on test data examples.",3.259259259259259,0.8425925925925926,3.482142857142857,54,2003
"We analyze these phenomena through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples.",4.230769230769231,0.8846153846153846,3.769230769230769,26,2003
"Finally, section 8 gives more discussion, by comparing the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank.",2.347826086956522,1.0434782608695652,2.652173913043478,23,2003
We aim to give some explanation of the differences in performance among the various models.,2.4375,1.0,2.125,16,2003
Probabilistic context-free grammars are the starting point for the models in this article.,2.2857142857142856,0.75,2.0625,14,2003
"For this reason we briey recap the theory behind nonlexicalized PCFGs, before moving to the lexicalized case.",2.8421052631578947,0.7894736842105263,2.8421052631578947,19,2003
"Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979), we dene a context-free grammar G as a 4-tuple (N, , A, R), where N is a set of nonterminal symbols,  is an alphabet, A is a distinguished start symbol in N, and R is a nite set of rules, in which each rule is of the form X   for some X  N,   (N  ) .",6.506666666666667,0.86,3.5,75,2003
The grammar denes a set of possible strings in the language and also denes a set of possible leftmost derivations under the grammar.,3.0833333333333335,0.8125,2.875,24,2003
Each derivation corresponds to a tree-sentence pair that is well formed under the grammar.,2.1333333333333333,1.0,2.588235294117647,15,2003
A probabilistic context-free grammar is a simple modication of a context-free grammar in which each rule in the grammar has an associated probability P( | X).,2.793103448275862,0.7586206896551724,3.71875,29,2003
"This can be interpreted as the conditional probability of Xs being expanded using the rule X  , as opposed to one of the other possibilities for expanding X listed in the grammar.",2.515151515151515,1.0303030303030303,3.138888888888889,33,2003
"The probability of a derivation is then a product of terms, each term corresponding to a rule application in the derivation.",2.391304347826087,0.8913043478260869,2.652173913043478,23,2003
"The probability of a given tree-sentence pair (T, S) derived by n applications of context-free rules LHSi  RHSi (where LHS stands for left-hand side, RHS for right-hand side), 1  i  n, under the PCFG is  Booth and Thompson (1973) specify the conditions under which the PCFG does in fact dene a distribution over the possible derivations (trees) generated by the underlying grammar.",3.68,1.0133333333333334,4.2967032967032965,75,2003
The rst condition is that the rule probabilities dene conditional distributions over how each nonterminal in the grammar can expand.,2.4285714285714284,0.9761904761904762,2.857142857142857,21,2003
The second is a technical condition that guarantees that the stochastic process generating trees terminates in a nite number of steps with probability one.,2.44,1.02,2.36,25,2003
A central problem in PCFGs is to dene the conditional probability P( | X) for each rule X   in the grammar.,3.3333333333333335,0.7916666666666666,3.08,24,2003
A simple way to do this is to take counts from a treebank and then to use the maximum-likelihood estimates.,3.1904761904761907,0.9285714285714286,2.8260869565217392,21,2003
"If the treebank has actually been generated from a probabilistic context-free grammar with the same rules and nonterminals as the model, then in the limit, as the training sample size approaches innity, the probability distribution implied by these estimates will converge to the distribution of the underlying grammar.2  Once the model has been trained, we have a model that denes P(T, S) for any sentence-tree pair in the grammar.",5.2025316455696204,0.8607594936708861,3.876543209876543,79,2003
"The output on a new test sentence S is the most likely tree under this model,  The parser itself is an algorithm that searches for the tree, Tbest, that maximizes P(T, S).",2.875,1.0,3.076923076923077,40,2003
"In the case of PCFGs, this can be accomplished using a variant of the CKY algorithm applied to weighted grammars (providing that the PCFG can be converted to an equivalent PCFG in Chomsky normal form); see, for example, Manning and Sch utze (1999).",4.788461538461538,0.9230769230769231,4.384615384615385,52,2003
"If the model probabilities P(T, S) are the same as the true distribution generating training and test examples, returning the most likely tree under P(T, S) will be optimal in terms of minimizing the expected error rate (number of incorrect trees) on newly drawn test examples.",4.258620689655173,0.8362068965517241,3.7222222222222223,58,2003
"Hence if the data are generated by a PCFG, and there are enough training examples for the maximum-likelihood estimates to converge to the true values, then this parsing method will be optimal.",5.457142857142857,0.7285714285714285,4.081081081081081,35,2003
"In practice, these assumptions cannot be veried and are arguably quite strong, but these limitations have not prevented generative models from being successfully applied to many NLP and speech tasks.",3.9411764705882355,0.6029411764705882,2.9411764705882355,34,2003
(See Collins [2002] for a discussion of other ways of conceptualizing the parsing problem.),2.8947368421052633,0.9473684210526315,3.210526315789474,19,2003
"In the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993), which is the source of data for our experiments, the rules are either internal to the tree, where LHS is a nonterminal and RHS is a string of one or more nonterminals, or lexical, where LHS is a part-of-speech tag and RHS is a word.",5.171875,0.859375,3.4558823529411766,64,2003
(See Figure 1 for an example.),2.4444444444444446,0.7222222222222222,2.4444444444444446,9,2003
2.2 Lexicalized PCFGs A PCFG can be lexicalized3 by associating a word w and a part-of-speech (POS) tag t with each nonterminal X in the tree.,2.9655172413793105,0.9137931034482759,3.393939393939394,29,2003
(See Figure 2 for an example tree.),2.6,0.65,2.7,10,2003
The PCFG model can be applied to these lexicalized rules and trees in exactly the same way as before.,2.8,0.675,2.6,20,2003
"Whereas before the nonterminals were simple (for example, S or NP), they are now extended to include a word and part-of-speech tag (for example, S(bought,VBD) or NP(IBM,NNP)).",4.377777777777778,0.7666666666666667,4.066666666666666,45,2003
"Thus we write a nonterminal as X(x), where x = (cid.6)w, t(cid.7) and X is a constituent label.",4.75,0.765625,4.583333333333333,32,2003
"Formally, nothing has changed, we have just vastly increased the number of nonterminals in the grammar (by up to a factor of |V|  |T |,  2 This point is actually more subtle than it rst appears (we thank one of the anonymous reviewers for pointing this out), and we were unable to nd proofs of this property in the literature for PCFGs.",5.36986301369863,1.047945205479452,4.541666666666667,73,2003
"The rule probabilities for any nonterminal that appears with probability greater than zero in parse derivations will converge to their underlying values, by the usual properties of maximum-likelihood estimation for multinomial distributions.",3.0294117647058822,0.8823529411764706,2.861111111111111,34,2003
"Assuming that the underlying PCFG generating training examples meet both criteria in Booth and Thompson (1973), it can be shown that convergence of rule probabilities implies that the distribution over trees will converge to that of the underlying PCFG, at least when Kullback-Liebler divergence or the innity norm is taken to be the measure of distance between the two distributions.",3.876923076923077,0.9615384615384616,3.582089552238806,65,2003
Thanks to Tommi Jaakkola and Nathan Srebro for discussions on this topic.,2.4615384615384617,0.8461538461538461,2.5384615384615383,13,2003
3 We nd lexical heads in Penn Treebank data using the rules described in Appendix A of Collins (1999).,3.090909090909091,1.0227272727272727,2.5454545454545454,22,2003
The rules are a modied version of a head table provided by David Magerman and used in the parser described in Magerman (1995).,2.5,0.8653846153846154,3.1153846153846154,26,2003

where |V| is the number of words in the vocabulary and |T | is the number of part-ofspeech tags).,3.7083333333333335,0.875,2.6956521739130435,24,2003
"Although nothing has changed from a formal point of view, the practical consequences of expanding the number of nonterminals quickly become apparent when one is attempting to dene a method for parameter estimation.",3.8285714285714287,1.1,2.857142857142857,35,2003
"The simplest solution would be to use the maximum-likelihood estimate as in equation (1), for example,  But the addition of lexical items makes the statistics for this estimate very sparse.",4.2,0.7285714285714285,4.184210526315789,35,2003
"The count for the denominator is likely to be relatively low, and the number of outcomes (possible lexicalized RHSs) is huge, meaning that the numerator is very likely to be zero.",4.722222222222222,0.8472222222222222,3.0833333333333335,36,2003
Predicting the whole lexicalized rule in one go is too big a step.,3.4285714285714284,0.6428571428571429,2.7857142857142856,14,2003

"We dene nonrecursive NPs (from here on referred to as base-NPs and labeled NPB rather than NP) as NPs that do not directly dominate an NP themselves, unless the dominated NP is a possessive NP (i.e., it directly dominates a POS-tag POS).",4.142857142857143,0.9591836734693877,3.509433962264151,49,2003
Figure 8 gives some examples.,1.6666666666666667,0.75,1.5,6,2003
Base-NPs deserve special treatment for three reasons.,1.75,0.9375,1.9,8,2003
"Because of this, the probability of generating the STOP symbol should be greatly increased when the previous modier is, for example, a determiner.",2.962962962962963,0.8703703703703703,3.4074074074074074,27,2003

"As a result, the model will assign unreasonably high probabilities to NPs such as [NP yesterday the dog] in sentences such as Yesterday the dog barked.",3.033333333333333,0.8666666666666667,2.3,30,2003
The annotation standard in the treebank leaves the internal structure of base-NPs underspecied.,2.857142857142857,1.0,2.1875,14,2003
"For example, both pet food volume (where pet modies food and food modies volume) and vanilla ice cream (where both vanilla and ice modify cream) would have the structure NPB  NN NN NN.",4.743589743589744,0.7692307692307693,5.675,39,2003
"Because of this, there is no reason to believe that modiers within NPBs are dependent on the head rather than the previous modier.",2.56,0.98,2.72,25,2003

In general it is important (in particular for the distance measure to be effective) to have different nonterminal labels for what are effectively different X-bar levels.,3.0344827586206895,1.0344827586206897,3.6451612903225805,29,2003

Coordination constructions are another example in which the independence assumptions in the basic models fail badly (at least given the current annotation method in the treebank).,3.413793103448276,0.8620689655172413,3.8275862068965516,29,2003
The independence assumptions mean that the model fails to learn that there is always exactly one phrase following the coordinator (CC).,2.2916666666666665,1.0,2.4583333333333335,24,2003
The basic probability models will give much too high probabilities to unlikely phrases such as NP  NP CC or NP  NP CC NP NP.,2.92,0.54,2.814814814814815,25,2003
"For this reason we alter the generative process to allow generation of both the coordinator and the following phrase in one step; instead of just generating a nonterminal at each step, a nonterminal and a binary-valued coord ag are generated.",4.6976744186046515,0.7906976744186046,3.8666666666666667,43,2003

"Note the new type of parameter, Pcc, for the generation of the coordinator word and POS tag.",3.1,0.675,2.8,20,2003

This section describes how punctuation is integrated into the generative models.,1.9166666666666667,1.0,2.3333333333333335,12,2003
Our rst step is to raise punctuation as high in the parse trees as possible.,2.6875,0.9375,2.25,16,2003
"Punctuation at the beginning or end of sentences is removed from the training/test data altogether.13 All punctuation items apart from those tagged as comma or colon (items such as quotation marks and periods, tagged   or . )",4.15,0.875,3.0232558139534884,40,2003
are removed altogether.,1.25,1.125,1.0,4,2003
"These transformations mean that punctuation always appears between two nonterminals, as opposed to appearing at the end of a phrase.",2.3181818181818183,1.0454545454545454,2.590909090909091,22,2003

"13 As one of the anonymous reviewers of this article pointed out, this choice of discarding the  sentence-nal punctuation may not be optimal, as the nal punctuation mark may well carry useful information about the sentence structure.",3.65,0.825,4.046511627906977,40,2003
Punctuation is then treated in a very similar way to coordination.,2.25,0.9583333333333334,2.1666666666666665,12,2003
Our intuition is that there is a strong dependency between the punctuation mark and the modier generated after it.,2.8,0.9,2.3,20,2003
Punctuation is therefore generated with the following phrase through a punc ag that is similar to the coord ag (a binary-valued feature equal to one if a punctuation mark is generated with the following phrase).,2.789473684210526,0.9078947368421053,3.375,38,2003
Pp is a new parameter type for generation of punctuation tag/word pairs.,2.3076923076923075,0.8076923076923077,2.466666666666667,13,2003
The generation of punc=1 along with ADJP(old) in the example implicitly requires generation of a punctuation tag/word pair through the Pp parameter.,4.0,0.875,2.730769230769231,28,2003
"The generation of this tag/word pair is conditioned on the two words in the punctuation dependency (Vinken and old in the example) and the label on their relationship (NP,NPB,ADJP in the example.)",4.414634146341464,0.7926829268292683,4.162790697674419,41,2003
Sentences in the treebank occur frequently with PRO subjects that may or may not be controlled.,2.6470588235294117,0.9411764705882353,2.411764705882353,17,2003

For these reasons we modify the nonterminal for sentences without subjects to be SG (see gure 11).,3.0,1.075,2.6,20,2003
The resulting model has a cleaner division of subcategorization.,2.3,0.75,1.8,10,2003

The next few sections give further explanation of the differences between Charniaks models and the models in this article.,2.75,0.775,2.1904761904761907,20,2003
8.1.1 Additional Features of Charniaks Model.,2.0,0.5714285714285714,1.875,7,2003
There are some notable additional features of Charniaks model.,2.3,0.75,2.4545454545454546,10,2003
"First, the rule probabilities are conditioned on the parent of the nonterminal being expanded.",2.3125,0.84375,2.5625,16,2003
"Our models do not include this information, although distinguishing recursive from nonrecursive NPs can be considered a reduced form of this information.",2.5,0.7291666666666666,3.25,24,2003
(See section 7.3.2 for a discussion of this distinction; the arguments in that section are also motivation for Charniaks choice of conditioning on the parent.),3.689655172413793,0.9310344827586207,2.8333333333333335,29,2003
"Second, Charniak uses word-class information to smooth probabilities and reports a 0.35% improvement from this feature.",3.0,0.8421052631578947,3.2857142857142856,19,2003
"Finally, Charniak uses 30 million words of text for unsupervised training.",2.230769230769231,0.9615384615384616,2.1538461538461537,13,2003
A parser is trained from the treebank and used to parse this text; statistics are then collected from this machine-parsed text and merged with the treebank statistics to train a second model.,3.3823529411764706,0.7647058823529411,3.1666666666666665,34,2003
This gives a 0.5% improvement in performance.,2.2222222222222223,0.9444444444444444,2.111111111111111,9,2003
8.1.2 The Dependency Parameters of Charniaks Model.,2.0,0.75,1.2222222222222223,8,2003
"Though similar to ours, Charniaks dependency parameters are conditioned on less information.",2.857142857142857,0.8214285714285714,2.2666666666666666,14,2003
"As noted previously, whereas our parameters are PL2(lwi | Li, lti, c, p, P, H, w, t, , LC), Charniaks parameters in our notation would be PL2(lwi | Li, P, w).",6.92,0.63,3.625,50,2003
The additional information included in our models is as follows.,2.090909090909091,1.0454545454545454,1.7272727272727273,11,2003
H The head nonterminal label (VP in the previous prots/rose example).,2.5714285714285716,0.7857142857142857,1.8125,14,2003
At rst glance this might seem redundant.,2.25,0.9375,1.75,8,2003
"For example, an S will usually take a VP as its head.",2.5,0.75,2.5,14,2003
"In some cases, however, the head label can vary.",3.6666666666666665,0.625,3.1666666666666665,12,2003
"For example, an S can take another S as its head in coordination cases.",2.4375,0.78125,2.3125,16,2003
"lti, t The POS tags for the head and modier words.",2.5384615384615383,0.6153846153846154,2.076923076923077,13,2003
Inclusion of these tags allows our models to use POS tags as word class information.,2.3125,0.875,2.375,16,2003
Charniaks model may be missing an important generalization in this respect.,2.0833333333333335,0.7916666666666666,2.0,12,2003
Charniak (2000) shows that using the POS tags as word class information in the model is important for parsing accuracy.,2.782608695652174,0.9130434782608695,3.8260869565217392,23,2003
8.1.3 The Rule Parameters of Charniaks Model.,2.0,0.75,1.2222222222222223,8,2003
"The rule parameters in Charniaks model are effectively decomposed into our L1 parameters (section 5.1), the head parameters, andin models 2 and 3the subcategorization and gap parameters.",4.5625,0.578125,3.057142857142857,32,2003
This decomposition allows our model to assign probability to rules not seen in training data.,2.0625,0.9375,2.1875,16,2003
See section 7.4 for an extensive discussion.,1.875,0.8125,2.125,8,2003
8.1.4 Right-Branching Structures in Charniaks Model.,2.0,0.5714285714285714,2.0,7,2003
Our models use distance features to encode preferences for right-branching structures.,1.9166666666666667,1.0,2.2142857142857144,12,2003
Charniaks model does not represent this information explicitly but instead learns it implicitly through rule probabilities.,3.0588235294117645,0.7941176470588235,2.611111111111111,17,2003
"For example, for an NP PP PP sequence, the preference for a right-branching structure is encoded through a much higher probability for the rule NP  NP PP than for the rule NP  NP PP PP.",3.8947368421052633,0.5394736842105263,4.642857142857143,38,2003
(Note that conditioning on the rules parent is needed to disallow the structure [NP [NP PP] PP]; see Johnson [1997] for further discussion.),4.2727272727272725,0.8939393939393939,3.5294117647058822,33,2003
This strategy does not encode all of the information in the distance measure.,2.0714285714285716,0.8214285714285714,2.0,14,2003
The distance measure effectively penalizes rules NP  NPB NP PP where the middle NP contains a verb.,2.888888888888889,0.8611111111111112,3.0526315789473686,18,2003
In this case the PP modication results in a dependency that crosses a verb.,2.4,1.1,2.066666666666667,15,2003
"Charniaks model is unable to distinguish cases in which the middle NP contains a verb (i.e., the PP modication crosses a verb) from those in which it does not.",3.3333333333333335,1.196969696969697,3.1470588235294117,33,2003

"(1994), and Magerman (1995).",2.8,0.8,2.5,10,2003

"A weakness, we will argue in this section, is the method of associating parameters with transitions taken by bottom-up, shift-reduce-style parsers.",2.72,0.94,3.3548387096774195,25,2003
We give examples in which this method leads to the parameters unnecessarily fragmenting the training data in some cases or ignoring important context in other cases.,2.7777777777777777,0.9629629629629629,3.0,27,2003
