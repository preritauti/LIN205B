"A question regarding the approaches in this paper is whether the features we have described could be incorporated in a maximum-entropy tagger, giving similar improvements in accuracy.",2.793103448275862,1.0344827586206897,3.3870967741935485,29,2002

The problem described here is closely related to the label bias problem described in (Lafferty et al.,3.1578947368421053,0.9736842105263158,2.263157894736842,19,2002
2001).,1.0,0.3333333333333333,1.0,3,2002
One straightforward way to incorporate global features into the maximum-entropy model would be  to introduce new features whether the tagging decision which indicated in the history   cre ates a particular global feature.,2.909090909090909,0.8333333333333334,3.4054054054054053,33,2002
"The decision which effectively created the entity University for was the decision to tag for as C, and this has already been made.",4.52,0.92,3.0,25,2002
The independence assumptions in maximum-entropy taggers of this form often lead points of local ambiguity (in this example the tag for the word for) to create globally implausible structures with unreasonably high scores.,3.4166666666666665,1.0,2.9210526315789473,36,2002
